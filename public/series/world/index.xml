        <description>What is Nanotechnology? Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the study and application of extremely small things and can be used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, and engineering. It is the leading technology in the world where all the material are been made on the nanoscale level, you must have not been noticed that Microcontroller which we are using in our circuits and much more applications are been made up to the nanoscale level which is called VLSI Very Large Scale Integration.</description>

Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the study and application of extremely small things and can be used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, and engineering. It is the leading technology in the world where all the material are been made on the nanoscale level, you must have not been noticed that &lt;code&gt;Microcontroller&lt;/code&gt; which we are using in our circuits and much more applications are been made up to the nanoscale level which is called &lt;code&gt;VLSI&lt;/code&gt; Very Large Scale Integration. Nanotechnology is also called nanotech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;origins&#34;&gt;Origins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Wikipidia&lt;/sup&gt; The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by renowned physicist &lt;code&gt;Richard Feynman&lt;/code&gt; in his talk &lt;code&gt;There&#39;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom&lt;/code&gt;, in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;code&gt;Nanotechnology&lt;/code&gt; was first used by &lt;code&gt;Norio Taniguchi&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;1974&lt;/code&gt;, though it was not widely known. Inspired by Feynman&amp;rsquo;s concepts, &lt;code&gt;K. Eric Drexler&lt;/code&gt; used the term &lt;code&gt;nanotechnology&lt;/code&gt; in his 1986 book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pdfdrive.com/engines-of-creation-20-the-coming-era-of-nanotechnology-e158355030.html&#34;&gt;Engines of Creation: The Comming Era of Nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt; which proposed the idea of a nanoscale &amp;ldquo;assembler&amp;rdquo; which would be able to build a copy of itself and the items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control. It&amp;rsquo;s also been said that nanotechnology will be able to perform AI level operation which will help to eradicate those diseases which humans can&amp;rsquo;t remove it, say for example &lt;code&gt;AIDS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Radioactive materials&lt;/code&gt; from the body, also this &lt;code&gt;CoronaVirus&lt;/code&gt; from current pandemic year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fundamental-concepts&#34;&gt;Fundamental Concepts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale. This covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced. In its original sense, nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up, using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete, high performance products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nanometer (nm) is one billionth, or 10−9, of a meter. By comparison, typical carbon-carbon bond lengths, or the spacing between these atoms in a molecule, are in the range 0.12–0.15 nm, and a DNA double-helix has a diameter around 2 nm. On the other hand, the smallest cellular life-forms, the bacteria of the genus Mycoplasma, are around 200 nm in length. By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range 1 to 100 nm following the definition used by the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the US. The lower limit is set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the smallest atoms, which are approximately a quarter of a nm kinetic diameter) since nanotechnology must build its devices from atoms and molecules. The upper limit is more or less arbitrary but is around the size below which phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device.[26] These new phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices which are merely miniaturised versions of an equivalent macroscopic device; such devices are on a larger scale and come under the description of microtechnology.[27]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put that scale in another context, the comparative size of a nanometer to a meter is the same as that of a marble to the size of the earth.[28] Or another way of putting it: a nanometer is the amount an average man&amp;rsquo;s beard grows in the time it takes him to raise the razor to his face.[28]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two main approaches are used in nanotechnology. In the &amp;ldquo;bottom-up&amp;rdquo; approach, materials and devices are built from molecular components which assemble themselves chemically by principles of molecular recognition.[29] In the &amp;ldquo;top-down&amp;rdquo; approach, nano-objects are constructed from larger entities without atomic-level control.[30]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Areas of physics such as nanoelectronics, nanomechanics, nanophotonics and nanoionics have evolved during the last few decades to provide a basic scientific foundation of nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;current-research&#34;&gt;Current research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;nanomaterials&#34;&gt;Nanomaterials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nanomaterials field includes subfields which develop or study materials having unique properties arising from their nanoscale dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface and colloid science has given rise to many materials which may be useful in nanotechnology, such as carbon nanotubes and other fullerenes, and various nanoparticles and nanorods. Nanomaterials with fast ion transport are related also to nanoionics and nanoelectronics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nanoscale materials can also be used for bulk applications; most present commercial applications of nanotechnology are of this flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Progress has been made in using these materials for medical applications; see Nanomedicine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nanoscale materials such as nanopillars are sometimes used in solar cells which combats the cost of traditional silicon solar cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development of applications incorporating semiconductor nanoparticles to be used in the next generation of products, such as display technology, lighting, solar cells and biological imaging; see quantum dots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent application of nanomaterials include a range of biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, antibacterials and biosensors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;research-and-development&#34;&gt;Research and development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Prior to 2012, the USA invested $3.7 billion using its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the European Union invested $1.2 billion, and Japan invested $750 million. Over sixty countries created nanotechnology research and development (R&amp;amp;D) programs between 2001 and 2004. In 2012, the US and EU each invested $2.1 billion on nanotechnology research, followed by Japan with $1.2 billion. Global investment reached $7.9 billion in 2012. Government funding was exceeded by corporate R&amp;amp;D spending on nanotechnology research, which was $10 billion in 2012. The largest corporate R&amp;amp;D spenders were from the US, Japan and Germany which accounted for a combined $7.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content:encoded>&lt;h2 id=&#34;recap&#34;&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation/&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, we have talked about &lt;strong&gt;Quantum Computers&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Facebook AI Chat&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Predictions of AI Robots&lt;/strong&gt; wherein &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-2/&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt; we had a recap of &lt;strong&gt;part 1&lt;/strong&gt; and also &lt;strong&gt;The Matrix&lt;/strong&gt; movie, &lt;strong&gt;Roswell UFO Incident&lt;/strong&gt;, wherein &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-3/&#34;&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt; we discussed on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-3/#what-is-mkultra&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MKUltra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; performed by &lt;code&gt;US Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-3/#black-mirror-bandersnatch&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; movie where you can control &lt;strong&gt;Stefan Butler&lt;/strong&gt; by given two choices which leads to a different path in the movies. In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-4/&#34;&gt;part 4&lt;/a&gt; we talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-4/#ufo&#34;&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt; also we seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-4/#space-mysteries&#34;&gt;Space Mysteries&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code&gt;Restored Apollo 11&lt;/code&gt; and also we saw the video a mysterious video where an unidentified spacecraft refuelling itself from the sun. In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-5/&#34;&gt;part 5&lt;/a&gt; we talked about time travel where we seen some of the most known time travel and reference in the article about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-5/#who-was-sid-hurwich&#34;&gt;Sid Hurwich&lt;/a&gt; which was about time machine which can &lt;code&gt;Freeze Time&lt;/code&gt;, also we saw many mysteries of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-5/#mike-tyson-match&#34;&gt;Mike Tyson Match&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-5/#charlie-chaplin-moive&#34;&gt;Charlie Chaplin Moive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-5/#london-bridge-opening&#34;&gt;London Bridge Opening&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-5/#a-man-from-2256&#34;&gt;A man from 2256&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-5/#swiss-ring-watch&#34;&gt;Swiss ring watch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-5/#1500-years-old-mummy-wearing-adidas-sneaker-shoe&#34;&gt;1500 years old mummy wearing Adidas sneaker shoe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-5/#17th-century-astronaut&#34;&gt;17th century astronaut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-5/#the-man-from-taured&#34;&gt;The man from Taured&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-5/#john-titor&#34;&gt;John Titor&lt;/a&gt; well if the time travel is possible then it would be much more terrifying then we thought because they can go back to time and change the future or can destroy the future but there are many rules of travelling back or forward in time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cicada-3301&#34;&gt;Cicada 3301&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;everything-you-need-to-know-about-cicada-3301-an-internet-mystery&#34;&gt;Everything you need to know about Cicada 3301 (An internet Mystery)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of late, you can find several puzzle games online available in the market for users all around the world. These puzzle games are easy to play and you are not going to face any issues or confusion for sure. But Cicada 3301 is something different from those types of puzzle games which you might have played in the past with your family members and relatives in your free time. On the year 4th January 2012, the mysterious and hardest puzzle on the internet was launched named “Cicada 3301”. It is one of the most mysterious and elaborate puzzles available today for people across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the puzzles each year has been to carefully recruit the best and talented individuals. But the ultimate purpose is still not known to the people. As per some reviews, it has been stated that Cicada 3301 is mainly a secret society to improve privacy, cryptography, and anonymity. It would be better for you to understand that the name Cicada 3301 is given to a mysterious internet organization which has published sets of puzzle several times to recruit the most intelligent and fastest code breakers from all around the world. This puzzle was first published on sites like 4chan and Reddit and remains active for nearly a month. Do you want to know more about the Cicada 3301 and how it works? If yes is your answer, then here you would get all the information you are looking for right now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-the-points-of-cicada-3301&#34;&gt;What are the Points of Cicada 3301?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main point of Cicada 3301 is to recruit highly intelligent and educated fast code breakers from all over the world through the sets of puzzles. They are looking for highly experienced and talented individuals. To search them, they have devised a test. Also, there is a message hidden in the image and you need to find them to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-did-cicada-3301-start&#34;&gt;When did Cicada 3301 start?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/cicada-3301.png&#34; alt=&#34;Cicada 3301&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the year 4th of January 2012, the mysterious and hardest puzzle on the internet was launched named “Cicada 3301”. It is one of the most mysterious and elaborate puzzles available today for people worldwide. It is a puzzle where you need to have a good deal of technical knowledge, an understanding of number theory, including philosophy, classical music, knowledge of artist references, technological references, Mayan numerology, mathematics, cyberpunk literature, and the life cycles of cicadas. As per some speculations, Cicada 3301 is well-funded and large, considering that it has the deep knowledge to create such complex puzzles and at the same time, capable of supporting the existence of clues in a large number of locations, all far from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year 2012, it was started, and then soon after one year, it again started for the people to solve the puzzles. There are thousands of people who have tried to solve the puzzle from their side but not able to do it due to a lack of intelligent and education skills. The puzzle looks similar to other online puzzles but very difficult to solve it. You should be well educated and highly intelligent for solving it easily without any problem. The mysterious organization Cicada 3301 has been releasing online encryptions since 2012, drawing top code-breakers to accept the challenges and nobody knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;who-is-cicada-3301&#34;&gt;Who is Cicada 3301?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cicada 3301 is a nickname given to an organization and it is not related to a particular person. All the set of puzzles to hire code breakers mainly focused on steganography, data security, cryptography, and even internet anonymity. Most people have claimed recently that Cicada 3301 is a secret society to improve anonymity, privacy, and cryptography. Some others have claimed that Cicada 3301 is a cult or religion. By considering the official statement of people who won the 2012 puzzle, 3301 uses non-puzzle based recruiting methods but created the puzzles because they were only looking for educated members with computer security and cryptography skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-the-mission-of-cicada-3301&#34;&gt;What is the mission of Cicada 3301?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/mission-cicada-3301.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Mission&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main mission of Cicada 3301 is still not known to the people due to its mysterious nature of work. As per some people reviews, it has been cleared that it is mainly for hiring intelligent and educated people in the organization. But the type of organization is still not known to the people and expected to be revealed very soon in the future for sure. This mysterious organization is trying to recruit the fastest and intelligent code breakers from all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-happens-to-those-who-solve-cicada-3301&#34;&gt;What happens to those who solve cicada 3301?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those people who solve cicada 3301 still in a dilemma and they are not able to understand what is the main reason behind creating those puzzles. In a recent interview, Puzzle solvers have also mentioned the puzzles they have solved from their end and how it is not so easy for them in the beginning. It is an internet mystery and people are getting aware of it. Many folks have tried from their end but some of them become successful and some of them did not get much success in solving those highly complex problems. It is expected that soon a new puzzle set will be published on the site and people are waiting to try their luck. In the future, it has been cleared that people will show more excitement and eagerness to solve these puzzles, and soon we will come to know about some more people who are giving it a try for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-was-the-purpose-of-cicasa-3301&#34;&gt;What was the purpose of Cicasa 3301?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is normally believed that the results of solving the puzzle would lead the individuals to better know who these people are. As a participant, you are going to solve one puzzle and then another puzzle will be given to you with much-increasing difficulty level for sure. All the participants need to have high and strong knowledge regarding “Cryptography, coding, Steganography, Encryption, and many more. It is a famous mystery as people want to know who these people who have started this puzzle. Also, want to know the main reason behind hiring such intelligent individuals in a team. As per certain claims, it is believed it to be a secret society while others normally believed that Cicada 3301 is a religion or cult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2013, it was the time of round 3 puzzles. Once again the image includes the message and the message led to the book and also book led to the link. The procedure was the same as before but this time message led to the book named “ Liber Primus” ( First book). The book was written in Latin and originated from Russia. The book was a mystery for most people and many still not able to know the exact reason behind it. However, a significant portion of the book has yet to be translated. Out of 74 pages, only 19 pages have been successfully translated. From the year 2015 to now, no puzzles have been found but still internet users all around the world waiting for this mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you are aware of the Cicada 3301 and how it was solved by Joel and Marcus. All the above-mentioned points will help you in knowing what is Cicada 3301 and how it becomes an internet mystery for the users worldwide. You should note that the Cicada puzzle is not simple as most of the other puzzles available online and you need to be very educated and highly intelligent for solving the complex puzzles for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started back in 2011 when a Reddit account began posting an indecipherable sequence of numbers and letters to a new subreddit, r/A858DE45F56D9BC9, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9&#34;&gt;r/A858&lt;/a&gt; for short. After languishing in Internet obscurity for nearly a year, another Reddit user requested more information, asking: &amp;ldquo;Do these seemingly random strings of numbers &amp;hellip; correlate to something; is there some big joke I’m missing out on?&amp;rdquo; There was no reply, but enough people began to wonder the same thing themselves, and soon a sister subreddit, r/Solving_A858, was born. It consisted of &amp;ldquo;a dedicated group of computer science students, amateur cryptographers, and motivated enthusiasts&amp;rdquo; working together to crack the code, if indeed that&amp;rsquo;s what it was, reports the Daily Dot. At first, the creator kept the subreddit private, with only those proving themselves worthy allowed in, but it eventually opened to the public. It all started back in 2011 when a Reddit account began posting an indecipherable sequence of numbers and letters to a new subreddit, r/A858DE45F56D9BC9, or r/A858 for short. After languishing in Internet obscurity for nearly a year, another Reddit user requested more information, asking: &amp;ldquo;Do these seemingly random strings of numbers &amp;hellip; correlate to something; is there some big joke I’m missing out on?&amp;rdquo; There was no reply, but enough people began to wonder the same thing themselves, and soon a sister subreddit, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/&#34;&gt;r/Solving_A858&lt;/a&gt;, was born.

At first, the creator kept the subreddit private, with only those proving themselves worthy allowed in, but it eventually opened to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today only a few of the thousands of r/A858 posts have been decoded, but they tend to be cryptic—such as an excerpt from the book Actions and Passions by Max Lerner and the ASCII image of Stonehenge, reported Bustle last year. The subreddit creator was pretty much silent until August 2015 when an account appeared in the sister &amp;ldquo;solving&amp;rdquo; subreddit that (after appropriate code-breaking, of course) allowed users to ask questions. Still, any answers were themselves cryptic, such as: &amp;ldquo;We cannot disclose the purpose. A858 will end when the purpose is disclosed or discovered.&amp;rdquo; Then on March 29, after having been private for some time (it switches between private and public regularly), r/A858 suddenly read: &amp;ldquo;The A858 Project Has Concluded. You may unsubscribe.&amp;rdquo; Many still think the project isn&amp;rsquo;t over. &amp;ldquo;I only hope A858 has a purpose,&amp;rdquo; one user writes. &amp;ldquo;I don’t particularly care if it is a good one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;india&#34;&gt;India&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alochonaa.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/india.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;India&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has been called the land of mysteries since time immemorial, whether for its various enigmatic natural phenomena or eccentricities associated with its religions and culture. And while science has worked hard to debunk and find a logical reason behind every riddle, there remain some that give rationalists a run for their money. Here are some of modern India’s most puzzling aspects that are bound to make your eyes pop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;kodinhi--keralas-village-of-twins&#34;&gt;Kodinhi – Kerala’s village of twins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dC3fXAKSqsU/U5l3FHR6pfI/AAAAAAAABco/WbtxNtA_eLk/s1600/Kodinhi2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Twin Town&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By any metric, conceiving twins and triplets is a rare natural occurrence around the world. In fact, on average only 16 out of 1,000 successful pregnancies in the world result in twins and this average is even lower in India at just 9. However, this ratio is heavily skewed in the sleepy hamlet of Kodinhi in Kerala, which has a record 400 pairs of twins in a population of just over 2,000 families! Geneticists and scientists have long tried to explain this rare phenomenon but are only now making some headway. While experts have pointed to genetics as an obvious factor, what’s even more mysterious is that irrespective of religion, lineage or their original heritage, all families living in the village have conceived more than the average pairs of twins over the last few generations, and the number is consistently growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tanjores-brihadeeswara-temple&#34;&gt;Tanjore’s Brihadeeswara Temple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jXTo2ZBydmk/WKX35fAuIoI/AAAAAAAAFRU/CHTrCTtdOlAIfaE2O0UY0S6WiaAReVQJwCLcB/s1600/Brihadeeswarar_Temple_Full_View.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tanjore’s Brihadeeswara Temple&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘Big Temple’ in Thanjavur is renowned across the world as an architectural marvel and is one of India’s 36 World Heritage Sites. While there are many imposing and majestic temples in Tamil Nadu, what makes this temple particularly interesting is its architectural mysteries that still confound many. The granite structure is popular for having one of the tallest gopurams in India and at the apex lies an 81-tonne monolithic Shikhara mounted at a height of 66 meters. While architecture and science have advanced over centuries to create much greater marvels, taken in the context of its era of construction, dating back more than 1,000 years, this aspect of the temple still baffles experts. Questions about how the heavy and huge Shikhara was mounted at such a height and how such massive amounts of granite were carried to the site with no recorded quarries in the vicinity are still unanswered. By some accounts, the tower is constructed in such a way that it does not cast a shadow at noon on any day of the year as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prahlad-jani--indias-fasting-fakir&#34;&gt;Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.guioteca.com/cultura-india/files/2014/01/Prahlad-Jani.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is a land of eccentric saints and sadhus, but none of these gurus has raised worldwide interest and flummoxed experts as much as Prahlad Jani, the sadhu who claims to have fasted without food or water for over 40 years. His claims had long been taken with a pinch of salt by scientists and experts and outright dismissed by rationalists. However, in 2010, Jani was part of an extensive study by a team of 35 Indian experts from the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Science, which lasted over 15 days. While the study was shrouded in mystery with the government deciding not to divulge any details, it was widely publicised that the guru, also known as Mataji, was in good health despite not eating or drinking water and being in isolation for more than ten days. What’s more, it was further claimed that he did not urinate or excrete during the duration of the tests. While the veracity of this account is still an open question, it certainly has raised interest among the world’s leading experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;kirti-stambha--the-iron-pillar-of-delhi&#34;&gt;Kirti Stambha – the Iron Pillar of Delhi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Iron_pillar_delhi.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kirti Stambha – the Iron Pillar of Delhi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the concept of rust-resistant iron only became prominent during the industrial revolution in western civilization, there stands an iron pillar in Delhi that predates such known material technology by nearly a millennium! The Kirti Stambha or victory pillar of Delhi is a six-tonne structure that is constructed out of iron sometime in the 5th century and has stood the test of time without succumbing to rust. The science of this pillar has baffled scientists, primarily for the fact that such advanced technology for rust resistance was thought to be unknown elsewhere in the world at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-time&#34;&gt;What is Time?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/sup&gt; Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in the material and reality or the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is been told that time has never stopped or will never be stopped its a continuous flow. If we try to make changes in past or future it will affect the path one mistake and everything is messed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;time-travel&#34;&gt;Time Travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/time.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Time&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object or a person, typically with the use of a hypothetical device known as a time machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;can-we-go-back-in-time&#34;&gt;Can we go back in time?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/predestination.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Predestination&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although humans can&amp;rsquo;t hop into a time machine and go back in time, we do know that clocks on aeroplanes and satellites travel at a different speed than those on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-did-we-knew-that-time-travel-is-possible&#34;&gt;When did we knew that time travel is possible?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 100 years ago, a famous scientist named Albert Einstein came up with an idea about how time works. He called it relativity. This theory says that time and space are linked together. Einstein also said our universe has a speed limit: nothing can travel faster than the speed of light (186,000 miles per second).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-was-sid-hurwich&#34;&gt;Who was Sid Hurwich?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/sidhurwich.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sid Hurwich&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in 1918, Sid Hurwich was a Jewish appliance repairman living in Toronto Canada who used to experiment with various kinds of technology. As a child, Sid showed great interest in collecting random junk and assembling the pieces into working machines. Later as an adult, he became famous as the man who could fix anything that was broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1934, Sid earned the distinction of being the first private appliance repairman in all of Canada. He was such a skilled technician that the local power company succeeded in taking him out of the army so he could develop the infrastructure of the public electrical utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sid Hurwich earned enough money to set up two successful companies of his own. He was still young when he got a heart attack, only 36 and he retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;extraordinary-time-machine-that-could-freeze-time&#34;&gt;EXTRAORDINARY TIME MACHINE THAT COULD ‘FREEZE TIME’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he continued to experiment with technology and finally invented that extraordinary ‘freeze time’ machine that could also change the flow of time, and send out beams of influence to manipulate objects in distant locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local authorities had problems to catch thieves in the wave of bank robberies that swept Toronto in 1969. So Hurwich contacted them and said that is possible to freeze time to find out what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This account was given in the article in the Vancouver Sun-Times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘All I recall,’ said Bolton (one of the police officers in charge), ‘is that it was under the table – the device, whatever it was – and there was a bedspread over the table. He froze my service revolver. You couldn’t pull the trigger, you couldn’t lift it off the table and even on the table you couldn’t pull the trigger.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then Sid said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…. Now take a look at your watches.” I remember one of them said, “When did this happen?” and I said, “The minute you walked through that door. You walked in there about 25 minutes ago. Now, look at your watches. You’re late about 25 minutes.”’ As the security officers filed out of his home, Sid’s wife overheard one of them suggest that the army should be told about the device. ‘That was the first time it entered my mind for war or army purposes or anything like that.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time machine later was used by military and it ended up in Israel, accorded in publication Foreign Report in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The device sends out electronic rays to alter the natural composition of electronic fields and centres of gravity of weapons, instrument dials and mechanical devices … (using) the Hurwich principle there was no reason why the new beams could not reach and disable tanks, ground-to-ground missiles and complete radar systems. The beams could also be tacked together to form a screen that would make whole zones safe from bombs and missiles,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But does they still have that device and do they still use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-happened-to-sid-hurwich-and-his-time-altering-machine&#34;&gt;What happened to Sid Hurwich and his time-altering machine?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the time machine is still in possession of the Israeli military or not has been widely debated. Does the Israeli military still have the Hurwich device, and are they still using it on ‘special occasions’ or in dire situations of military crisis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ‘True Time Travel’ book by Richard Bullivant is written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Skeptics say that if they had a device that could provide a kind of shield from bombs and missiles, freeze weapons, and even slow or halt time, the Israeli military would be invincible and would not have suffered as many casualties as it has in its decades&amp;rsquo; long struggles with its antagonists in the Mideast. Others counter, however, by saying that the Hurwich device may be a two-edged sword. If it can ‘freeze’ the weapons of the enemy, it would also freeze the weapons of those employing the device. Thus, the device can perhaps only be used in a limited way – enough to knock out radar detection and other enemy electronics, for example – but not to induce the full-blown time-freeze effect for the benefit of the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only Richard wrote about it, but and many people over the years. Also, he said to police that it is not a new invention, and it is designed on principles that are already well known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, researchers still can’t find out any information about him or his obituary. But, surely, he has passed on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1995 a match was played between the legendary boxers Mike Tyson and Peter McNeeley. It was not an extraordinary match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, when the footage of the match was watched closely next something unbelievable thing saw in the footage. In the footage, it was clear that someone was capturing the picture of Mike Tyson with a Smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, at that time, there was no existence of such types of smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is believed that he was that person who came from the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Circus” was the super hit movie of Charlie Chaplin which was released in 1928.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, when someone was watching the movie closely, he saw unusual stuff in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He saw there was a scene in the movie in which a lady was talking on a mobile phone like device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at that time there was no existence of a mobile phone. The first mobile cell phone came into existence in 1973 which was of Motorola. Here is the video of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all proofs of time travel, this assumes to be solid evidence of time travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo was captured in 1941, during the re-opening ceremony of the South Fork Bridge in Gold Bridge, British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The style of wearing a man’s clothes in this photo is completely contrasting from other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One gentleman is wearing a graphic t-shirt and black sunglass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is also a modern camera like device in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at that time all these things were not existed, which means these kinds of stuff were not invented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later the forensic report was also carried out of this photo but this image was found clean and clear; there was no tampering with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 44-year-old man &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/Was-Andrew-Carlssin-actually-from-the-future&#34;&gt;Andrew Carlssin&lt;/a&gt; was arrested on Jan 28, 2003, in Toronto, Canada, by FBI. He was detained on the suspicion of illegal inside information of the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because on the course of two weeks by investing just $800 he made out with over $350 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How was it possible? He made out around 126 high-risk trades and never loses a single cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, during the four-hour confession, he stated he came from 2256.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI did not get any evidence of fraud from his side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 3rd April 2003, an unidentified person came in the courtroom for a bail hearing and deposited $1 million for the bail of Andrew Carlssin. But after, they disappeared in the way and never have been met again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, the FBI could not find out where both of them came from and where they went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/Swiss-ring-watch.png&#34; alt=&#34;Swiss ring watch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A watch was discovered when archaeologists began unsealing a tomb in China. That tomb was from the Ming Dynasty, and it was of 400-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While unsealing they found a ring-like object inside the tomb. After investigation, it was found out that it was a small watch similar to be modern Swiss watch. This watch was 100 years old.&lt;br /&gt;
Interestingly, when you see the watch from the front, you can read the time clearly on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, archaeologists also found there was no tampering with the tomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, if there was no tampering then how this watch went inside the 300-year-old tomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astonishingly, at that time even Switzerland didn’t become a country. Many people correlate this puzzling discovery to time travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mongolian Mummy was found in the Altai Mountains at the height of 10,000 feet from the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mummy was of the 1500 years old, and the stunning thing about this was that this mummy was wearing Adidas like sneakers in her feet. (this mummy was assumed to be of a woman)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adidas is a German company that started on August 18, 1949, by Adi Dassler and it is famous for its footwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are relating the story of this mummy with the event of time travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mummy was found in April 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;17th-century-astronaut&#34;&gt;17th century astronaut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/Resolved_Mystery_Of_Salamanca_Astronaut_From_The_Cathedral_Of_16th_Century.png&#34; alt=&#34;17th-century astronaut&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Very few are aware that the Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin was the first person to travel to outer space in 1961. But the mystery remains unveiled is why there a figure that exactly looks like an astronaut engraved in the stone of a 16th-century cathedral?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built between 1513 and 1733 there is a new cathedral of Salamanca, Spain when space travel was hardly thought of. This has made some people curious to speculate about the origin of the carving: is this the evidence of time travel? Or some other creatures from different planet engraved it? Or is some paranormal force at a play?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Salamanca’s Astronaut is not a joke or a hoax, but a modern addition to the Cathedral; however, it has all the reserves of something which may provide confusion some 400 years from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Cathedral Of Salamanca&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The building began at a time when the Gothic style was merging with the new Renaissance style. This cathedral retained more of its gothic counter because the administrators and the supervisors wanted the new cathedral to merge with the old one. Two elements were added that broke with the predominant style of the building: a Baroque and the bell tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new cathedral of Salamanca was erected without the destruction of the old cathedral, but the walls of the newly erected lean on the North wall of the old one. This is the reason why the old cathedral had to be reinforced. The main entrance to the cathedral consists of three decorated arcs: each heading to the three naves of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Did Carve The Astronaut Picture On The Cathedral?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth behind this carving is, unfortunately, less interesting. When the church was rebuilt centuries ago it went a restoration program and the stonemasons decided to carve some modern figures. It is a tradition of the cathedral builders to add details or new carvings as a sort of some signature. In this case with the cathedral, quarryman Jeronimo Garcia given the action to add more images to the front of the building including an astronaut among some vines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also been a weird looking dragon eating ice cream (even the ice cream cones were not invented until the 20th century), a bull, a crayfish and a lynx.  But why the figures are chipped and broken even though it is not that much old? Vandalism in 2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/unidentified.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;unidentified image&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The vandalism has been recovered and now it has clear pictures today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the only church that has some modern addition engraved on the building, Calahorra Cathedral in Spain (from the 16th century) has a cell phone that was added in 1996.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-man-from-taured&#34;&gt;The man from Taured&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/the-Man-from-Taured.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The man from Taured&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Man from Taured (sometimes referred to as the Taured Mystery of the Man Without a Country ) is a story about a man who arrives at a Japanese airport from a country called Taured. Many people have claimed this story to be true, so the crux of the problem pertains to Taured. One would notice that there is no country by the name of Taured, either today or during the purported time when the incident took place, i.e. the 1950s. The story ends with the man disappearing (forever) a day after arriving in Japan. Moreover, all of his documents, such as his passport and driver’s license also (conveniently) disappeared, thus making this strange story unsolvable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-mans-arrivalthe-mans-arrival&#34;&gt;The Man’s ArrivalThe Man’s Arrival&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of the ‘Man from Taured’ begins quite specifically in many sources with a hot day in July 1954. On that particular day, a man was said to have arrived at Haneda Airport, known also as Tokyo International Airport. This man has been described as Caucasian looking with a beard. Whilst his primary language is said to have been French, it has been purported that he spoke Japanese and many other languages as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/Customs-service.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Customs service&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The sequence of events then differs according to which version of the story one encounters. In one version, this man hands over his passport to be stamped, and the Japanese immigration officer notices something strange. Whilst the passport looked authentic, the country where it was issued, ‘Taured’, was recognized as non-existent, either by the officer or one of his / her colleagues, indicating that the man should be taken away for interrogation. In another version, the man mentioned that he was from Taured, and when the immigration officer did not believe him, he showed him/her his passport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;location-of-taured&#34;&gt;Location of Taured&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next part of the story details the man trying to convince the immigration officers that Taured does indeed exist. According to the traveller, Taured was located between France and Spain and had by then been in existence for 1000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When shown a map, the man pointed to the area occupied by the Principality of Andorra and was puzzled as to why his country was called Andorra on the map. Both sides refused to give in – the Japanese officers insisted that Taured did not exist, and the traveller argued otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/Location-of-Andorra.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Location of Andorra&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;Location of Andorra (center of green circle) in Europe  (dark grey).&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;vanished&#34;&gt;Vanished!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the man was held by the officers, as they were suspicious that he might be some kind of criminal. They brought him to a nearby hotel for the night, whilst they conducted their investigation. To ensure that the man did not escape during the night, two guards were placed outside his room. The next morning, when the officers went to the man’s room, they realized that he had simply vanished, as there were no signs of his escape. Additionally, all of his documents, which may serve as evidence for the story’s validity, had disappeared as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;travel-through-time-or-space-or-just-an-exaggeration&#34;&gt;Travel Through Time or Space? Or Just an Exaggeration?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable explanations for this incident is that the man from Taured had somehow passed through a parallel dimension by accident, and ended up at Haneda Airport. It has been suggested that, based on this explanation, there is parallel earth which is similar to ours with the exception that the locations called Andorra here is known as Taured over there. Another suggestion is that the man was a time traveller from the future, thou this interpretation is arguably more problematic than the one supposing inter-dimensional travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has also been suggested that an incident like that did indeed happen, though perhaps much less sensational. This more mundane story could have been embellished each time it was told, so much so that it eventually evolved into the great mystery that it is known as today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is also entirely possible that this story is merely an urban legend. The story of the ‘Man from Taured’ might not have even occurred in the first place, and may have just been the creation of someone’s imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-titor&#34;&gt;John Titor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/john-titor.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;John Titor&#34; /&gt;&lt;sup&gt; Is this true that this person who was seen on &lt;a href=&#34;#london-bridge-opening&#34;&gt;London Bridge Opening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One legendary hoax captivated fans of the supernatural and the paranormal like few others. November 2, 2000, saw the first online post by the individual who would come to be known as &amp;ldquo;John Titor.&amp;rdquo; Titor claimed to be a man from the future, sent to the past to retrieve&amp;hellip; a portable computer. Though shrouded by forum avatars, his specific instructions on what he was here to accomplish, and what society would look like in his version of the future, kicked off a frenzy of investigation, speculation, and deception that has lasted for nearly two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people believed &amp;ldquo;John Titor&amp;rdquo; completely. Others became obsessed with errors and inconsistencies, digital detectives trying to uncover the truth behind the story. Before it was over, Titor would make his way to an animation studio in Japan, a wrestling ring in Pennsylvania, and a prison cell in Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Titor is a name used on several bulletin boards during 2000 and 2001 by a poster claiming to be an American military time traveller from 2036. Titor made numerous vague and specific predictions regarding calamitous events in 2004 and beyond, attracting world-wide attention during the ensuing decade. His descriptions of the aftermath of a nuclear war—including the devastation of numerous countries around the world, a breakup of the United States into five smaller sovereignties, and general destruction of the global environment and infrastructure—inspired fiction and music, and triggered investigations by journalists and others. Subsequent closer examination of Titor’s assertions provoked widespread scepticism. Inconsistencies in his explanations, the uniform inaccuracy of his predictions, and a private investigator’s findings all led to the general impression that the entire episode was an elaborate hoax. A 2009 investigation concluded that Titor was likely the creation of Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, along with his brother John, a computer scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;titors-post&#34;&gt;Titor&amp;rsquo;s Post&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first posts using John Titor’s military symbol appeared on the Time Travel Instituteforums on November 2, 2000, under the name TimeTravel_0. At that time the name “John Titor” was not being used. The posts discussed time travel in general, the first one being the “six parts” description of what a time machine would need to have to work (see below) and responses to questions about how such a machine would work. Early messages tended to be short. A second thread was also made due to shortcomings in the forum software at the time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name “John Titor” was not introduced until January 2001, when TimeTravel_0 began posting at the Art Bell BBS Forums (which required a name or pseudonym for every account). The Titor posts ended in late March 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 2003, various websites reproduced Titor’s posts, re-arranging them into narratives. Not all refer to the original dates posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/john-titor-ibm-5100.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IBM-5100&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his online postings, Titor claimed to be an American soldier from 2036, based in Tampa, Florida. He was assigned to a governmental time-travel project, and sent back to 1975 to retrieve an IBM 5100 computer which he said was needed to debug various legacy computer programs in 2036; a possible reference to the UNIX year 2038 problem. The IBM 5100 runs the APL and BASICprogramming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titor had been selected for this mission specifically, given that his paternal grandfather was directly involved with the assembly and programming of the 5100. Titor claimed to be on a stopover in the year 2000 for “personal reasons,” to collect pictures lost in the (future) civil war and to visit his family, of whom he spoke often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titor also said he had been, for a few months, trying to alert anyone that would listen about the threat of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease spread through beef products and about the possibility of civil war within the United States. When questioned about them by an online subscriber, Titor also expressed an interest in mysteries such as UFOs, which remained unexplained in his time. Titor suggested that UFOs and extraterrestrials might be travellers from much further into the future than his own time, with superior time machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;time-machine&#34;&gt;Time Machine&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titor described his time machine on several occasions. In an early post, he described it as a “stationary mass, temporal displacement unit powered by two top-spin, dual positive singularities”, producing a “standard off-set Tipler sinusoid”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest post was more explicit, saying it contained the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two magnetic housing units for the dual micro singularities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An electron injection manifold to alter mass and gravity of the micro singularities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A cooling and X-ray venting system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gravity sensors, or a variable gravity lock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four main caesium clocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three main computer units&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the posts, the device was installed in the rear of a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette convertible and later moved to a 1987 truck having four-wheel drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titor shared several scans of the manual of a “C204 Time Displacement Unit” with diagrams and schematics and posted some photographs of the device installed in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titor claimed that the “Everett–Wheeler model of quantum physics,” better known as the many-worlds interpretation, was correct. The model posits that every possible outcome of a quantum decision occurs in a separate “universe.” Titor stated that this was the reason the grandfather paradox would not happen; following the logic of the argument, Titor would be killing a different John Titor’s grandfather in a timeline other than his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grandfather paradox is impossible.&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, all paradox is impossible. The Everett–Wheeler–Graham or multiple world theory is correct.&lt;br /&gt;
All possible quantum states, events, possibilities, and outcomes are real, eventual, and occurring.&lt;br /&gt;
The chances of everything happening someplace at some time in the supervise are 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;predictions&#34;&gt;Predictions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although invoking the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, whereby events from his timeline may differ from our own, Titor also expressed assurance that the differences were minimal. As such, his descriptions have been interpreted as predictions and compared with historical events since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most immediate of Titor’s predictions was of an upcoming civil war in the United States having to do with “order and rights”.He described it as beginning in 2004, with civil unrest surrounding the presidential election of that year. This civil conflict that he characterized as “having a Waco type event every month that steadily gets worse” would be “pretty much at everyone’s doorstep” and erupt by 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the war, the United States would split into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives. This civil war, according to Titor, would end in 2015 with a brief but intense World War III.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titor refers to the exchange as “N Day”. Washington, D.C. and Jacksonville, Florida are specifically mentioned as being hit. After the war, Omaha, Nebraska would be the new U.S. capital. Titor was vague as to the exact motivations and causes for World War III. At one point, he characterized the hostilities as being led by “border clashes and overpopulation”. He also pointed to the contemporary conflict between Arabs and Israel as not a cause, but rather a milestone that precedes World War III.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titor claimed that as a 13-year-old in 2011, he joined the Fighting Diamondbacks, a shotgun infantry unit in Florida, for at least four years. In other posts, he described himself as hiding from the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;criticism-and-discussion&#34;&gt;Criticism and discussion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Titor gained significant attention, there also emerged analysis and discussion concerning the veracity of his claims about his origins and mission, and the future events he talked about. No John Titor or Titor family is known to exist, meaning that who posted as Titor used a pseudonym. The story has been called inconsistent as contradictions between statements at different times have been observed. Holding the many-worlds interpretation as correct, Titor claimed that his mission as a time traveller was to shape a timeline in which many chaotic events of his time, including World War III and the civil war in the US, never happened. In some supposed Titor’s appearances in the internet and other media segments before his main posts (notably in faxes to the radio talk show Coast to Coast AM in 1998), he stated that he was not able to change the future despite his efforts, suggesting one of the possible contradictions. Nevertheless, none of the specific events he predicted to a near future, chaotic or not, have come to happen (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some issues with the technology have also been considered. In one of Titor’s pictures of a supposed time machine, a laser beam is seen allegedly being bent by gravitational distortion, but the view of nearby objects is not distorted as would be expected. Also, Titor knew about technical features of the IBM 5100 which were not available to the public at the time, albeit widely commented in the industry, suggesting he had some advanced understanding of the machine or computers in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;predictive-failures&#34;&gt;Predictive failures&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Titor’s earliest assertions was that CERN would discover the basis for time travel sometime around 2001, with the creation of miniature black holes about half a year after his departure. This did not occur. An article published around the time he had predicted about miniature black holes created by CERN (a recurring theme, also ascribed to Fermilab and Brookhaven at various times)was taken by some to be evidence of this claim, but these events did not occur either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil war did not break out after the 2004 US presidential election, nor did conflicts or military involvement in 2012. World War III did not happen in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titor unambiguously claimed that the last Olympics would occur in 2004. While it is unclear if he meant the summer or winter Olympics, both have occurred since this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because Titor asserted that the many-worlds interpretation was proved correct by his time, his predictions could refer to another timeline and not ours, making them unfalsifiable. This led to different interpretations, including that he had effectively accomplished his mission by creating another timeline (despite his supposed previous statements that it would be too difficult), or that he inadvertently travelled to a different timeline (ours) and mistook it as his own, or that all-time travel is pointless if the chaotic timeline would not cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;story-and-consistency&#34;&gt;Story and consistency&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential contradictions have been observed in different Titor’s posts. In some of the posts, he claims that he was homeschooled, while in others he states that his basic education was conducted at the University of Florida. Similarly, he stated that he hid himself during the civil war in the U.S., while also stating in other instances that he fought in the war. In some posts, he claims that money is widely used and people still have credit cards, despite his statement that centralized banking no longer exists (this is either an inconsistency or implies the rise of private currencies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titor’s story could also have been inspired by science fiction works. The use of an automobile as a time machine, for example, had been a key plot device in the popular 1985 movie Back to the Future and its sequels (as the DeLorean sports car), among others. Additionally, commentators have pointed out similarities between the Titor story and Pat Frank‘s classic post-apocalyptic science fiction novel Alas, Babylon. Among other similarities, Alas, Babylon takes place in a small river-side town in Florida just before and after a nuclear war and describes the struggle to survive as a family in the aftermath. In the book, the protagonist lives in the fictional town of “Fort Repose”, while Titor claimed to live in the “Fort”, formerly the University of Florida. The prediction of tiny black holes as a result of time travel (specifically, the sending back of information) is a key plot point from the 1980 novel Thrice Upon A Time by James P. Hogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some suggested that yet in the summer of 1998 before his posts, Titor sent two faxes to Art Bell’s radio program Coast to Coast AM, stating that “Y2K is a disaster. Many people freeze to death trying to get to warmer weather. The gov. tries to keep power by instituting martial law…” referring to popular legends of the time about the Y2K bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the online story, Titor stated that a part of his mission was to prevent the coming world war by changing history. Yet some claimed that during an IRC chat in October 2000, a month before he began posting, Titor was asked if the future could be changed from his predictions, and answered: “It’s too late … I just wish things didn’t have to happen the way they will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;technology&#34;&gt;Technology&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titor provided an image of a detail of a supposed time machine, with a laser pointer beam “being bent by the gravitational field produced outside the vehicle by the distortion unit”. The beam being “bent” reveals an inconsistency of objects near the beam not appearing to be bent as well: the framing of the window visible in the background, for instance, should appear distorted in proximity to a large gravity gradient, but it does not. Some have speculated the “beam” is an optical fibre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titor claimed that he was sent back to obtain an IBM 5100 because it could translate several types of computer code. According to IBM engineer Bob Dubke, Titor’s statements regarding the IBM 5100’s little-known ability to emulate and debug mainframe systems were correct. Supporters state that this information was not publicly available in 2000 or 2001 when Titor made his declaration, and Titor himself stated that this feature was “discovered” as late as 2036 when Unix, as the underlying source behind all computer operating systems still running local infrastructures and other computational tasks, was only two years away from no longer functioning due to 32-bit integer limitations. However, this emulation capability was widely known in the industry and commented on in-depth in numerous publications dealing with both the 5100 and programmable microcode in general. References to this were also available on the Internet as early as 1999 and therefore predated Titor’s postings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;investigations&#34;&gt;Investigations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Italian television program, Voyager – Ai confini della conoscenza, aired the results of an investigation of John Titor on May 19, 2008. Private investigator Mike Lynch found no registry evidence, past or present, of any individual named John Titor. He did, however, identify the John Titor Foundation, a for-profit company formed on September 16, 2003, with no office or address other than a rented post box in Kissimmee, Florida. An IP address connected with Titor also geolocated to Kissimmee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a report by John Hughston of the Hoax Hunter website named Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, as the CEO of the foundation. Lynch concluded that Haber and his brother Morey Haber, a computer scientist, were very likely the men behind John Titor, whom they introduced in 1998, accompanied by different predictions, including chaos due to the Y2K“bug”. John Hughston also reported that John Titor is a registered trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;in-popular-culture&#34;&gt;In popular culture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2003, the John Titor Foundation published a book, John Titor: A Time Traveler’s Tale (ISBN 1-59196-436-9), discussing his claims; the book is now out of print.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2004, Time Traveler Zero, a play based on the John Titor story, was staged in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2009 visual novel Steins; Gate, which was adapted into a critically acclaimed anime in 2011, is centred on John Titor and his theories. A civil war caused by SERN (the fictional version of CERN), due to their discovery of time travel, is covered as well.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/biden-pres.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Featured Image&#34; class=&#34;featured-image&#34; style=&#34;width: ;height: ;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus News LIVE Updates: Tata Medical &amp;amp; Diagnostics is said to have started initial discussions with Moderna Inc for a partnership to launch its COVID-19 vaccine in India, the Economic Times reported today. Tata could team up with the India&amp;rsquo;s Council of Scientific &amp;amp; Industrial Research (CSIR) to carry out clinical trials of Moderna&amp;rsquo;s vaccine candidate in India, the report added, citing officials familiar with the matter. The Indian government this month gave emergency-use approval to a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd and state-run Indian Council of Medical Research, and another licensed from Oxford University and AstraZeneca PLC that is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of coronavirus cases in the United States crossed 25 million on Sunday, a Reuters tally showed, as states accelerate their vaccine distribution and more infectious strains are found globally. States including North Dakota and West Virginia have injected more than 83% of their allocated doses into residents&amp;rsquo; arms, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released on Sunday. Virginia administered the fewest doses, with 42% of the vaccines received. The United States has administered at least 21.8 million doses of COVID vaccines, to about 6% of its population. The two vaccines currently approved also require a second dose. Alaska leads the vaccine administration tally, with about 13% of its population vaccinated, followed by West Virginia, with 11%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden will announce he is re-imposing a Covid-19 travel ban on most non-US citizens who have been in Britain, Brazil, Ireland and much of Europe, a White House official said Sunday, as the new administration ramps up its pandemic response. Biden will also extend the ban to travelers who have recently been to South Africa amid warnings that new, more transmissible coronavirus variants are already establishing themselves in the United States, the official said, confirming US media reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Israel on Sunday announced a week-long ban on most incoming and outgoing flights in a bid to slow the spread of new variants of the novel coronavirus. The measure will begin at midnight from Monday into Tuesday and remain in effect until Sunday, a statement from the prime minister&amp;rsquo;s office said. Exceptions will be made for cargo and firefighting flights, as well as trips for medical treatments, funerals and legal procedures. A panel of health and interior ministry officials will be able to issue exemptions on request &amp;ldquo;for humanitarian or personal needs&amp;rdquo;, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision came with the country in its third national coronavirus lockdown, initiated late December and extended on Tuesday until the end of the month due to a surge in Covid-19 deaths. Earlier Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had announced his government&amp;rsquo;s intention to close the airport, as variants of the coronavirus have been detected in rising numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re closing the skies hermetically, except for rare exceptions, to prevent the entry of virus mutations, and to ensure that we make swift progress with our vaccination campaign,&amp;rdquo; he said ahead of a cabinet meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later Sunday, the health ministry announced it had identified cases of a coronavirus variant originating in Los Angeles. &amp;ldquo;In the health ministry&amp;rsquo;s central virus laboratory, a variant from Los Angeles has been located using a sequencing process,&amp;rdquo; the ministry said in a statement. &amp;ldquo;The person confirmed to have this variant has infected four other people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variants from South Africa and Britain have also been found in Israel. Since the rollout of vaccinations last month, more than 2.5 million of Israel&amp;rsquo;s nine-million-strong population have been vaccinated, according to the health ministry. On Saturday, Israel began vaccinating teens aged 16-18, who need to sit final high school exams.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;recap&#34;&gt;Recap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation/&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; we have talked about &lt;strong&gt;Quantum Computers&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Facebook AI Chat&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Predictions of AI Robots&lt;/strong&gt; where in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-2/&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt; we had a recap of &lt;strong&gt;part 1&lt;/strong&gt; and also &lt;strong&gt;The Matrix&lt;/strong&gt; movie, &lt;strong&gt;Roswell UFO Incident&lt;/strong&gt;, where in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-3/&#34;&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt; we discussed on &lt;a href=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-3/#what-is-mkultra&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MKUltra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; performed by &lt;code&gt;US Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-3/#black-mirror-bandersnatch&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; movie where you can control &lt;strong&gt;Stefan Butler&lt;/strong&gt; by given two choices which leads to different path in the movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ufo&#34;&gt;UFO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/pentagon-ufo-program.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pentagon UFO Program&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSA&lt;/code&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t the most publicly open of government organizations the agency&amp;rsquo;s main goal is to collect intelligence from various signal and then definition a clandestine organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iranian-ufos&#34;&gt;Iranian UFO&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another compelling report details an instance of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/ufo/assets/files/now_you_see.pdf&#34;&gt;UFO encounter in Tehran&lt;/a&gt; that was reported by numerous citizens just after midnight. The story is prefaced with a line saying that there is still no explanation to the account and that it will be, “filed away and probably forgotten, but it makes interesting, and possibly disturbing, reading.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a bright light in the sky was reported to an Iranian military officer, he scrambled a fighter jet to intercept it. The jet pilot said the light was so bright it could be seen from 70 miles away. Upon its approach, within 25 nautical miles, the jet lost all power to its instrumentation and communication. The object was spinning and emitted red, green, blue and orange light at a rate where all of the lights could be seen simultaneously. When a second jet was scrambled, the UFO moved away, maintaining a 25 mile buffer between itself and the jet. It then fired a detachment that chased the jet for a few miles. During this time, the jet attempted to fire back a missile, but lost its controls and communications before the detachment returned to the original UFO. The object then shot off another detachment that hit the ground on a dry lake bed, emitting a massive white light, but with no explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;space-mysteries&#34;&gt;Space Mysteries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was going through internet I found a video where its refueling itself from sun well I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that whether it is fake or real at first glance its seams to be real but it may be fake also. Check the video also see the the video of &lt;code&gt;Restored Apollo 11&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J4Q_ColFZUg&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/S9HdPi9Ikhk&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all know that NASA&amp;rsquo;s camera are more highly qualified and the resolution is more so my main point of question is where are the starts in the whole video also when they send photos from space there are no stars in the photo also when ISS lived there camera feed on YouTube then when the space station goes to dark side of the earth then why do they cut the feed of live stream and says that we are under maintenance, and not also that if you start the live feed in different PC or tab then it will start from a specific point right now if you will try to access it or search on YouTube then you will not be able to find it. Back in &lt;code&gt;2017&lt;/code&gt; there was a common question raised on &lt;code&gt;Bubbles in space&lt;/code&gt; many of reporter&amp;rsquo;s ask NASA about bubbles in the space, NASA denied that there was no bubble in the space but there were bubbles. Here is the video I recommend you to watch this videos in highest quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bubbles-in-space&#34;&gt;Bubbles in space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrHeDa5l-8c&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA train there astronaut underwater so that it feels like they are walking in the space. In May 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 2019 Astronaut named &lt;code&gt;Luca Parmitano&lt;/code&gt; nearly drowned while on &lt;strong&gt;spacewalk&lt;/strong&gt;. It is been clear that &lt;strong&gt;Luca Parmitano&lt;/strong&gt; and other astronaut were not in space, instead they were underwater training which means that NASA is using &lt;code&gt;VFX&lt;/code&gt; effects on green screen, which explain some of the green screen glitch anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nS0VN056d68&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/nS0VN056d68?t=307&#34;&gt;5:07&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;Astronaut Scott Kelly&lt;/code&gt; Questioned about &lt;code&gt;Bubbles in space&lt;/code&gt; as this question was many time repeated on internet its true that the live feed of ISS is been stopped and where as for other live feed which are been held by different YouTubers are fake may be not all but the top trending videos of space videos are fake say for example if you search in YouTube &lt;code&gt;ISS live feed&lt;/code&gt; in top 10 search you will get this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDU-rZs-Ic4&amp;amp;ab_channel=SPACE%28Official%29&#34;&gt;Space (Official)&lt;/a&gt; which is live from May 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2020 if you see its video then you can clearly see that an astronaut with his cam feed going live but when it turn toward another side in the space you can see clearly black color with no stars start the video from start&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DDU-rZs-Ic4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After starting the video from start play the video for &lt;code&gt;10-20 minutes&lt;/code&gt; so that you can see the space with no starts and after 10-20 minutes scroll the progressing bar till &lt;code&gt;-10:29:47&lt;/code&gt; let the play the video for 5 more minutes till &lt;code&gt;-10:28:04&lt;/code&gt; the video will play from the start it means that this vide is been recorded and repeated so it means that NASA has never landed on moon or on mars, also do you know that NASA is been received which was &lt;code&gt;64 light years&lt;/code&gt; far from our earth now its been said that if you place mirror 10 light years far from earth and then when you look at the mirror you will see earth 10 years behind. &lt;code&gt;Area 51&lt;/code&gt; is the place where alien sightings are too be seen but do you know that in year: &lt;code&gt;1959&lt;/code&gt; NASA took a photo of an unidentified craft in the shape of a flying saucer at NASA engineers at Dryden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/27331634_558433501156218_7082552310630800735_n.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Flying Saucer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the photo take by NASA which was been edited but when the photo was been analyzed the hoaxer who created the image, did not even bother to change the photograph identification number. On the photograph in question, you will note it says: E49-059 as a Photo Identification number. A quick search of the NASA Dryden Photo archives, reveals to real photograph with this ID number, and the buildings, engineers, etc. are identical. The hoaxer simply did some fancy Photoshop work – and inserted in a flying saucer to the original photograph, after deleting the actual aircraft. This is the original photo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/E49-059-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;NASA Dryden Flight Research Center Photo Collection&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding from above mysteries that NASA and other space stations are faking us about space and trying us to prevent us to see the truth that unidentified terrestrial begins are been controlling us on the earth and when someone who finds the truth are been completely vanished or been killed in an accidents which are shown that it was been an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In next part I will be talking about &lt;code&gt;SID HURWICH AND HIS ‘FREEZE TIME’ MACHINE&lt;/code&gt; so research about him and also read on time travel. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

When a handful of new coronavirus cases materialized this month in a province surrounding Beijing — apparently spread at a village wedding party — Chinese authorities bolted into action.
They locked down two cities with more than 17 million people, Shijiazhuang and Xingtai. They ordered a crash testing regime of nearly every resident there, which was completed in a matter of days.
 They shut down transportation and canceled weddings, funerals</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Steven Lee Myers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When a handful of new coronavirus cases materialized this month in a province surrounding &lt;code&gt;Beijing&lt;/code&gt; — apparently spread at a village wedding party — Chinese authorities bolted into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &lt;code&gt;locked down&lt;/code&gt; two cities with more than &lt;code&gt;17 million people&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Shijiazhuang and Xingtai&lt;/code&gt;. They ordered a crash testing regime of nearly every resident there, which was completed in a matter of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They shut down transportation and canceled weddings, funerals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and, most significantly, a provincial Communist Party conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this week the lockdowns expanded to include another city on the &lt;code&gt;edge of Beijing&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Langfang&lt;/code&gt;, as well as a county in &lt;code&gt;Heilongjiang&lt;/code&gt;, a northeastern province. Districts in Beijing itself, &lt;code&gt;the Chinese capital&lt;/code&gt;, also shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;More than 22 million people&lt;/code&gt; in all have been ordered to remain inside their homes — double the number affected in &lt;code&gt;January 2020&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;China’s central government locked down Wuhan&lt;/code&gt;, the central city where the virus was first reported, in a move that was then seen as extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flare-ups remain small compared with the devastation facing other countries, but they threaten to undercut the success the country’s Communist Party has had in subduing the virus, allowing its economy to surge back after last year’s slump and its people to return to something close to normal lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urgency of the government’s current response stands in contrast to that of officials in &lt;code&gt;Wuhan&lt;/code&gt; last year who feared a backlash if they disclosed the &lt;code&gt;mysterious new illnesses&lt;/code&gt; then emerging. Local officials there had gone ahead with a &lt;code&gt;Communist Party&lt;/code&gt; conference like the one now canceled in &lt;code&gt;Hebei&lt;/code&gt;, despite knowing the risk of the disease spreading among people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Wuhan, authorities have created a playbook that mobilizes party cadres to quickly respond to new outbreaks by sealing off neighborhoods, conducting widespread testing and quarantining large groups when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the process of infectious disease prevention and control, one of the key points is to seek truth from facts, to openly and transparently release epidemic information and never to allow covering up or underreporting,” the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, said at a meeting Friday of the State Council, China’s Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;China, a country of 1.4 billion people&lt;/code&gt;, has &lt;code&gt;reported&lt;/code&gt; an average of &lt;code&gt;109 new cases&lt;/code&gt; a day over the past week, according to a &lt;code&gt;New York Times database&lt;/code&gt;. Those would be welcome numbers in countries experiencing far worse — including the United States, which is averaging more than &lt;code&gt;250,000 new cases a day&lt;/code&gt; — but they are the worst in China since last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;China’s National Health Commission&lt;/code&gt; has not reported any new deaths, but the &lt;code&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/code&gt;, which uses information from China, has &lt;code&gt;recorded 12 so far in 2021&lt;/code&gt;. The National Health Commission did not respond to requests to explain the discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hebei, the province where the new outbreak has been concentrated, officials last week declared a “wartime state” that shows no sign of lifting soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the pandemic, officials have appeared especially worried about Beijing, home of the Communist Party’s central leadership. Last week, the &lt;code&gt;party secretary in Hebei, Wang Dongfeng,&lt;/code&gt; pledged to make sure the province was &lt;code&gt;“the moat to safeguard Beijing’s political security.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks, coming after so long with minimal cases, have increased anxiety across China, where residents in most places felt like the pandemic was a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;New cases&lt;/code&gt; have also been reported in the &lt;code&gt;northern province of Shanxi&lt;/code&gt; and the northeastern provinces of &lt;code&gt;Heilongjiang and Jilin&lt;/code&gt;. Shanghai on Wednesday urged residents not to leave the city and announced that people who had traveled to risky areas should quarantine themselves at home for two weeks and leave only after passing two tests, while those who had traveled to the &lt;code&gt;highest-risk areas&lt;/code&gt; faced quarantine in government facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wuhan, &lt;code&gt;rumors swirled&lt;/code&gt; that the city could face a &lt;code&gt;new lockdown&lt;/code&gt;; while those appeared unfounded, officials noticeably stepped up temperature checks on some streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Shunyi, a district in Beijing’s northeast that includes Beijing Capital International Airport as well as rural villages, residents have been ordered to remain inside since a surge of cases just before the new year. At Beijing’s main railroad stations, workers sprayed down public spaces with disinfectant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a &lt;code&gt;taxi driver tested positive&lt;/code&gt; over the weekend in &lt;code&gt;Beijing&lt;/code&gt;, authorities tracked down &lt;code&gt;144 passengers&lt;/code&gt; for additional tests, according to The Global Times, a state tabloid. &lt;code&gt;Now anyone getting in a taxi or car service in Beijing has to scan a QR code from their phone, allowing the government to quickly trace them.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has moved ahead on plans to &lt;code&gt;vaccinate 50 million people&lt;/code&gt; ahead of the &lt;code&gt;Lunar New Year next month&lt;/code&gt;, a holiday when hundreds of millions of people traditionally crisscross the country to visit their families. By Wednesday, more than &lt;code&gt;10 million doses had been distributed&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the vaccinations, officials have already warned people not to travel ahead of the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;“These measures, if well implemented, can ensure that no large-scale epidemic rebound occurs,”&lt;/code&gt; Feng Zijian, the deputy director of China’s Center for Disease Control, said at a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the new restrictions have inconvenienced millions, there appears to be no significant public resistance to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;“As far as I am concerned, I think measures like a lockdown for the whole city are actually quite good,”&lt;/code&gt; said Zhao Zhengyu, a university student in Beijing who is now confined to her parents’ home in Shijiazhuang, where she was visiting during winter break when the outbreak there erupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many in the city feared a repeat of Wuhan’s lockdown, but she sounded unfazed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhao’s parents now work from home, picking up groceries only from a market in their residential compound. She lamented that she could not meet friends or study in the library but said learning online has become routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps we have gotten used to it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response underscored how quickly the government mobilizes its resources to contain outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the lockdown was announced in Shijiazhuang on Jan. 6, authorities collected more than 10 million coronavirus test samples over the next three days — nearly one for every resident, officials said at a news conference in the city. Those tests turned up 354 positive results, although some of the cases were asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second round of mass nucleic acid testing began Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In effect, this is a kind of wartime system — using the means of wartime for social control in peacetime — and during a pandemic this wartime system works,” said Chen Min, a writer and former newspaper editor who goes by the pen name Xiao Shu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen was in Wuhan last year when the city went into lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of the country’s governance gave it the tools to tackle the epidemic — even if some measures seemed over the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chinese cities enforce a residential system — smaller ones have several hundred residents, big ones have tens of thousands — and by shutting the gates you can lock in tens of thousands of people,” Chen said in a telephone interview. “Now whenever they run into this kind of problem, they’re sure to apply this method. That would be impossible in Western countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>What you need to know about Bharat Biotech’s intranasal COVID-19 vaccine &amp;lsquo;BBV154&amp;rsquo;? Hyderabad: Bharat Biotech on Friday announced that it will begin the phase1 clinical trials of its new intranasal vaccine for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in February-March this year. The development came days after the Hyderabad-based firm received the Drugs Controller General of India’s (DCGI) nod for its COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin. Covaxin, which is India’s first indigenously developed COVID-19 vaccine, has been given restricted (emergency use) approval for use along with Serum Institute’s Covishield developed by the Oxford University in collaboration with AstraZeneca.</description>
        <content:encoded>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-you-need-to-know-about-bharat-biotechs-intranasal-covid-19-vaccine-bbv154&#34;&gt;What you need to know about Bharat Biotech’s intranasal COVID-19 vaccine &amp;lsquo;BBV154&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/nasal-vaccine-against-covid-19.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Vaccination&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/code&gt;: Bharat Biotech on Friday announced that it will begin the phase1 clinical trials of its new intranasal vaccine for the novel coronavirus (&lt;code&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/code&gt;) in February-March this year. The development came days after the Hyderabad-based firm received the &lt;code&gt;Drugs Controller General of India’s (DCGI)&lt;/code&gt; nod for its COVID-19 vaccine &lt;code&gt;Covaxin&lt;/code&gt;. Covaxin, which is India’s first indigenously developed COVID-19 vaccine, has been given restricted (emergency use) approval for use along with &lt;code&gt;Serum Institute’s Covishield&lt;/code&gt; developed by the &lt;code&gt;Oxford University&lt;/code&gt; in collaboration with &lt;code&gt;AstraZeneca&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in September, &lt;code&gt;Bharat Biotech&lt;/code&gt; announced that it has partnered with &lt;code&gt;Washington University School&lt;/code&gt; of Medicine in &lt;code&gt;St Louis&lt;/code&gt; for a novel &lt;code&gt;intranasal coronavirus vaccine (BBV154)&lt;/code&gt;. The phase 1 human clinical trials of the nasal COVID-19 vaccine will be &lt;code&gt;conducted in India&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Saint Louis University’s Vaccine&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Treatment Evaluation Unit&lt;/code&gt;. And here’s what we know so far about the company’s intranasal COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bbv154-to-be-a-single-dose-regimen&#34;&gt;BBV154 to be a single-dose regimen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharat Biotech’s &lt;code&gt;BBV154&lt;/code&gt; (a novel adenovirus vectored, intranasal vaccine for COVID-19) will be a &lt;code&gt;single-dose regimen&lt;/code&gt;. According to the company, an intranasal vaccine stimulates broad immune responses at the site of infection (in the &lt;code&gt;nasal mucosa&lt;/code&gt;), which is essential for blocking both infection and transmission of the &lt;code&gt;SARS-CoV-2 virus&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;non-invasive-needle-free&#34;&gt;Non-invasive, needle-free&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of an intranasal vaccine is that it is simple to administer - the jab is administered to a person via the nose and does not require a needle or trained healthcare workers to give the vaccine. This also means eliminating needle-associated risks such as injuries and infections. The vaccine is also ideally suitable for children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An intranasal vaccine will not only be simple to administer but reduce the use of medical consumables such as needles, syringes, etc., significantly impacting the overall cost of a vaccination drive,” Dr Krishna Ella, Chairman and Managing Director of Bharat Biotech, had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One drop of vaccine in each of the nostrils is sufficient,” he had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demonstrates-protective-efficacy&#34;&gt;Demonstrates protective efficacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said its intranasal vaccine candidate has demonstrated unprecedented levels of protection in mice studies - with the technology and data having been published in the &lt;code&gt;prestigious scientific journal Cell&lt;/code&gt; and in an editorial in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mice and hamsters immunized with a single dose of &lt;code&gt;ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S&lt;/code&gt; conferred superior protection against &lt;code&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/code&gt; challenge, more so than one or two intramuscular immunizations of the same vaccine and dose. Post-challenge with SARS-CoV-2, viral clearance was observed in both lower and upper airways. Thus, intranasal immunization of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S can create an immune response in the nose, which is the point of entry for the virus - thereby protecting against disease, infection, and transmission,” the company said in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bharatbiotech.com/intranasal-vaccine.html&#34;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;code&gt;Bharat Biotech&lt;/code&gt; has successfully completed &lt;code&gt;enrollment of 25,800 volunteers&lt;/code&gt; for the crucial, phase 3 trials of Covaxin developed indigenously in partnership with the &lt;code&gt;Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;National Institute of Virology (NIV)&lt;/code&gt;. The vaccine innovator said &lt;code&gt;Covaxin&lt;/code&gt; is a highly purified and &lt;code&gt;inactivated 2-dose&lt;/code&gt; COVID-19 vaccine, manufactured in a &lt;code&gt;Vero cell&lt;/code&gt; manufacturing platform with an excellent safety track record of more than &lt;code&gt;300 million doses&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content:encoded>&lt;h2 id=&#34;vaccination-approved&#34;&gt;Vaccination Approved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a short, eight-minute statement at 11 am on January 3, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) Dr V.G. Somani announced that his office had authorised two COVID-19 vaccine candidates for restricted use in the country. With the statement, India officially stood at the cusp of one of the world’s largest vaccination drives. But while the moment is suffused with hope, it will pay to remember at all times what exactly will happen from today: not a well-understood or well-planned event, and still hinged – for all the celebration of the science – on good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within hours of the UK approving AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, the company began rolling out thousands of doses for distribution among the country’s high-priority groups. This kind of speed would have been possible only if AstraZeneca had assumed the candidate would be approved and had amassed enough doses for distribution at the country’s doorstep. But while this attitude could seem presumptuous and off-putting at other times, it’s apparently necessary during an ongoing pandemic – especially with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/novel-coronavirus-d614g-mutation-rna-virus-replication-covid-19-pandemic/&#34;&gt;more contagious form&lt;/a&gt; of the virus showing up recently, and the AstraZeneca candidate being the cheaper option by far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, this is the excuse many people, including some experts, are advancing for rushing various aspects of vaccine production and distribution as much as possible. This is unfortunate. The pandemic is only part of the reason, and perhaps even in the minority, among all reasons that AstraZeneca is accelerating its candidate’s availability. A major one is that the Pfizer/BioNTech collaboration has taken a big lead in the US and the UK with its high-efficacy mRNA vaccine candidate, with Moderna a close second in the US market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three candidates are two-shot vaccines, and the total population of the US and the UK is nearly 400 million. So given current manufacturing capacity, no single candidate will single-handedly be able to sate demands in both markets, especially since demand is also high. So all three candidates are certainly in contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these companies have all been making their moves with at least one eye planted on the stock-markets. Stories of Pfizer’s windfall and the profits for its CEO when its candidate was approved for emergency use in the US are already part of pandemic lore. According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-vaccine-universally-available-big-pharma-monopolies/&#34;&gt;one estimate&lt;/a&gt;, the company is set to make $13 billion in profits in 2021 alone. So as such AstraZeneca is already late, and if it is to catch up, it must become available asap in the US and the UK, and try to press a first-mover advantage where it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pressing-the-advantage&#34;&gt;Pressing the advantage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is one such place. The Serum Institute of India has a deal with AstraZeneca to manufacture its candidate for sale in other markets, as well as to make and distribute doses for sale in India, under the name ‘Covishield’. On January 1, the subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) recommended that the vaccine candidate be approved for restricted use. On January 3, DCGI Dr Somani approved the candidate, as well as Bharat Biotech’s counterpart, named Covaxin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed is awe-inspiring – but in India, it may also be a quirk of doing business. As &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://thewire.in/health/adar-poonawalla-serum-institute-covid-19-vaccine&#34;&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt;, “American and European governments have promised vaccine-makers billions of dollars to offset potential losses” in exchange for the makers to start manufacturing even before candidates are approved. But at least as of August 2020, the Indian government hadn’t made any such promises, leaving only companies that could afford to write-off large losses with the ability to start manufacturing early. Serum Institute was one such company. Its CEO Adar Poonawalla &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/asia/coronavirus-vaccine-india.html&#34;&gt;told &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it wanted to get a head-start because it could afford to, after investing upwards of Rs 3,300 crore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Happy new year, everyone! All the risks &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SerumInstIndia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@SerumInstIndia&lt;/a&gt; took with stockpiling the vaccine, have finally paid off. COVISHIELD, India&amp;#39;s first COVID-19 vaccine is approved, safe, effective and ready to roll-out in the coming weeks. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/TcKh4bZIKK&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/TcKh4bZIKK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Adar Poonawalla (@adarpoonawalla) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/adarpoonawalla/status/1345605880381784067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;January 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, all of this is scant justification for how much we don’t know about Covishield, or about the other candidates for that matter – if only because we are at risk of fooling ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Covishield’s case at least, there is an unsettled dispute between one of its vaccine trial participants and Serum Institute. The former has sued the latter for Rs 5 crore, by way of compensation for a neurological side-effect that the participant has claimed arose as a result of being administered Covishield. Serum Institute subsequently threatened to counter-sue for Rs 100 crore, alleging defamation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Shreya Dasgupta &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-serum-institute-clinical-trials-chennai-volunteer-communication-ethics-dcgi/&#34;&gt;reported for &lt;em&gt;The Wire Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Serum Institute’s response doesn’t inspire confidence in its version of events – more so since informed consent in the context of clinical trials is not as iron-clad an indemnification as some might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate is also knee-deep in trouble in the UK, where an advisory group to the government has expressed doubts about the company’s claim that the candidate could be more effective if the first of its two doses is halved in quantity. This claim arose from an accident during its phase 2 clinical trials, when a subgroup of participants received a full dose + half dose regimen by mistake, but which still reported 28 percentage points more efficacy. The company got in even more trouble after it &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/the-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-data-isnt-up-to-snuff/&#34;&gt;became known&lt;/a&gt; that it may have cherry-picked data from its trials to share with governments for approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serum Institute only appears to be following suit. The company is conducting bridging trials in India, which can help find if a vaccine candidate tested elsewhere will elicit an immune response in the Indian population as well. Out of a pool of 1,600 participants, Serum Institute submitted data pertaining to only 100 volunteers to the CDSCO’s subject expert committee, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-serum-institute-of-indias-covid-19-vaccine-covishield-likely-to-be-approved-for-emergency-use-in-india/article33472324.ece&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hindu&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Bear in mind that this is a vaccine to be distributed to over a billion people in India alone, and the committee has recommended it based on data from only a hundred of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Bharat Biotech: the Covaxin vaccine candidate’s efficacy data isn’t in the public domain – nor are details from its phase 1 and 2 clinical trials and about how the company has estimated the figure &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-bharat-biotechs-covaxin-expected-to-be-60-effective-company-says/&#34;&gt;to be around 60%&lt;/a&gt;. That the DCGI’s approval is &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.thewire.in/health/biocon-itolizumab-covid-national-task-force-19-dcgi-approval-phase-2-cdsco/&#34;&gt;entirely opaque&lt;/a&gt; only makes this more of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sidestepping-criticism&#34;&gt;Sidestepping criticism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03115608/Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-11.55.32-AM.png&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr V.G. Somani addressing the press on January 3, 2021. Source: PIB/YouTube&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not all. The head of the UK advisory group, Munir Pirmohamed, &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.thewire.in/health/still-in-the-weeds-uk-nod-for-astrazeneca-vaccine-raises-more-questions/&#34;&gt;recently said&lt;/a&gt; that when the group analysed the data AstraZeneca had submitted for its candidate’s approval, it found that the higher efficacy in the subgroup of participants that received the full-dose/half-dose regimen could in fact have been the result of a longer gap between the two doses, and not the altered dose volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-second-dose-the-hindu-editorial-on-covid-19-vaccine-clearance-in-india/article33475177.ece&#34;&gt;has since approved&lt;/a&gt; a strategy to distribute the first dose to recipients as quickly as possible, since there is enough data to believe it provokes an immune response. However, we don’t know how the strength and duration of the response will vary in time, and whether the candidate will be just as efficacious if the second dose is delayed by more than a certain period. And yet again there is a caveat: the strategy to increase the gap between the two doses may not just be because the efficacy may be higher, but also because AstraZeneca may be &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.box.com/s/uwwn2dv4o2d0ena726gf4403f3p2acnu&#34;&gt;having issues&lt;/a&gt; with supply!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t this a shoddy path to vaccine approval, full of serendipities and experimental manoeuvres? As drug-discovery chemist &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Dereklowe/status/1344644941339889669&#34;&gt;Derek Lowe said&lt;/a&gt;, the pandemic, and the virus’s new mutation that allows it to spread faster through populations, may still be able to make a good case to support this kind of breakneck speed – but neither the UK government nor anyone else actually knows what they are doing. It’s a dice-roll (with a somewhat loaded die, but still) to be performed with millions of people, in the hopes that a vaccine candidate will work as intended. And AstraZeneca is not alone here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Sandhya Srinivasan, consulting editor at the &lt;em&gt;Indian Journal of Medical Ethics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-vaccines-immunisation-insufficient-tests-financial-stake-vaccine-related-injuries/&#34;&gt;wrote late last year&lt;/a&gt;, we don’t have vaccines – we have vaccine candidates. This is an important distinction because the candidates have been or are being tested in a way that doesn’t check if they’re good at preventing severe illness and if they are safe for the high-priority groups who will receive the first doses – especially the elderly. Both Srinivasan and S. Swaminathan, a retired scientist in New Delhi, have also &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-clinical-trials-adverse-events-severe-disease-proven-technology/&#34;&gt;expressed concerns&lt;/a&gt; about clinical trials overestimating vaccine efficacy by relaxing the threshold of effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most pernicious defence of these practices has been to accuse anyone who asks uncomfortable questions of being “anti-vaxxers”. Anti-vaxx is short for ‘anti-vaccination’, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.thewire.in/health/mmr-vaccination-autism/&#34;&gt;movement opposed to using vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate diseases because its members believe vaccines &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; diseases instead. Anti-vaxxers are typically supporters of far-right ideologies, but those heaping the accusation on demands for accountability are assuming a similarly extreme, and unfeasible, position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India at least, the drug approval process might as well not happen, considering the extent to which it is shrouded in secrecy, even as corporate leaders use high-handed tactics and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kiranshaw/status/1283371081089216512&#34;&gt;arguments of nationalism&lt;/a&gt; to shutdown complaints of malpractice and wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vaccine-apartheid&#34;&gt;Vaccine apartheid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piling on top of this is the newly emerging – but historically familiar – “vaccine apartheid”. As &lt;a href=&#34;https://theintercept.com/2020/12/31/covid-vaccine-countries-scarcity-access/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on December 31, 2020, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine candidate was tested in clinical trials with almost 44,000 participants across “Argentina, South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey as well as the US”. However,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina, South Africa, Brazil and Turkey will have to be satisfied with Pfizer’s gratitude, because … they won’t be receiving enough of the vaccine to inoculate their populations, at least not anytime soon. Meanwhile, the US and Germany — along with Canada and the rest of the EU — have contracted for enough doses of various COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate their populations several times over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar story of discrimination played out vis-à-vis severe adverse events during the trials of AstraZeneca’s candidate. When such an event &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-put-on-hold-due-to-suspected-adverse-reaction-in-participant-in-the-u-k/&#34;&gt;was reported&lt;/a&gt; in the UK trials, the company responded by temporarily halting the trials and launching an enquiry based on a set of predetermined, &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-participant-illness-aefi-data-safety-what-next/&#34;&gt;well-understood guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. News of the event also hit the headlines worldwide within a day or two. Once the enquiry concluded, the trials resumed without any glitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, however, Serum Institute claims it followed a similar process, as required under Indian law, but which culminated with the participant filing a case against the company. In addition, the event had occurred in early October but came to light only in late November. Other participants of the same trial also said they were contemplating legal action because they hadn’t been informed of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the richer west, vaccine-makers’ attitude seems to be “what’s there to hide”. But in India, and other similar ‘developing countries’, it’s “what’s there to see”. This is why stakeholders – which is practically everyone – must ask more questions and seek more clarity about how vaccine candidates are being approved and sold in India. ‘Cancelling’ those who disagree would be tantamount to ‘cancelling’ ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Project MKUltra (or MK-Ultra)&lt;/code&gt; also known as &lt;code&gt;CIA mind control Program&lt;/code&gt;, is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects that were designed and undertaken by the &lt;code&gt;US Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/code&gt;, some of which were illegal. Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations in order to be used in interrogation in order to weaken the individual and force confessions through mind control. The project was organized through the &lt;code&gt;Office of Scientific Intelligence&lt;/code&gt; of the CIA and coordinated with the &lt;code&gt;United State Army Biological Warfare Laboratories&lt;/code&gt;. Other code name for the drug related experiments were &lt;code&gt;Project Bluebird&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Project Artichoke&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation was officially sanctioned in 1953, reduced in scope in 1964 and further curtailed in 1967. it was officially halted in 1973. The program also engaged in illegal activities, including the used of US and Canadian citizens as its unwitting test subjects, which led to controversy regarding it legitimacy. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects&amp;rsquo; mental states and brain functions. Techniques included the covert administration of high doses of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug&#34;&gt;psychoactive drug&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD&#34;&gt;LSD&lt;/a&gt;) and other chemicals, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory, deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of Project MKUltra was broad, with research undertaken at more then 80 institutions, including colleges and universities hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA operated using front organizations, although sometimes top of officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA&amp;rsquo;s involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the &lt;code&gt;Church Committee&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;United States Congress&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Gerald Ford&#39;s United States President&#39;s Commission on CIA activities within the United States&lt;/code&gt; (also known as the Rockefeller Commission).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigative effects were hampered by CIA Director &lt;code&gt;Richard Helms&lt;/code&gt; order that all MKUltra files by &lt;code&gt;destroyed in 1973&lt;/code&gt; the Church Committee and &lt;code&gt;Rockefeller Commission&lt;/code&gt; investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the rtelatively small number of documents that survived Helms&amp;rsquo;s destruction order. In 1997, a &lt;code&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/code&gt; requested uncovered a cache of &lt;code&gt;20,000 documents&lt;/code&gt; related to project MKUltra which led to senate hearings later that year. Some surviving information regarding MKUltra was declassified in &lt;code&gt;July 2001&lt;/code&gt;. In &lt;code&gt;December 2018&lt;/code&gt;, declassified documents included a letter to an unidentified doctor discussing work on six dogs made to run, turn and stop via remote control and brain implants. Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/cia-mkultra-collection/&#34;&gt;TheBlackVault&lt;/a&gt; has the owner had &lt;code&gt;FOIA request&lt;/code&gt; for all the documents pertaining to MKULTRA and related projects back in the late 1990s.

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-black-mirror-bandersnatch&#34;&gt;What is Black Mirror: Bandersnatch?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Wikipidia&lt;/sup&gt; Black Mirror: Bandersnatch is a interactive film in the science fiction anathology of serise &lt;code&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/code&gt;. It was been written by serise creator &lt;code&gt;Charlie Brooker&lt;/code&gt; and directed by &lt;code&gt;David Slade&lt;/code&gt;. Netflix did not conirm the interactive nature of Bandersnatch until its release, though there was much media speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this movie viewers make decisions for the main character, the young programmer &lt;code&gt;Stefan Butler&lt;/code&gt;, who is adapting a fantasy gamebook into video game in 1984. In this game you have to select choice&amp;rsquo;s to move forward every path has option to choice and your selection will decide you future action similar to that this movie has the same interface in &lt;code&gt;Netflix&lt;/code&gt; you have to also select your action what our programmer &lt;code&gt;Stefan Butler&lt;/code&gt; will do this will take you next stage there are multiple ending&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the above picture you can see that you have to make choice whether to &lt;code&gt;THROW TEA OVER COMPUTER&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;SHOUT AT DAD&lt;/code&gt; according to that Stefan Butler does the action. There are multiple option in the movie where you will be confused and also some option will take you backward in the movie for different ending. At a point of movie with selecting the same option will take you to a scene when &lt;code&gt;Colin&lt;/code&gt; explain Stefan the concept of &lt;code&gt;PAC-man&lt;/code&gt; where the &lt;code&gt;PAC&lt;/code&gt; word belong to &lt;code&gt;Program Access and Control&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/D3qxWbQ8qek?t=45&#34;&gt;PAC-man Explanation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also reference to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-2/&#34;&gt;Matrix&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/D3qxWbQ8qek?t=75&#34;&gt;1:15s&lt;/a&gt; in the video Colin speak of code &lt;code&gt;IT&#39;S ALL CODE IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY YOU CAN HEAR THE NUMBER&#39;S&lt;/code&gt; this is also reference to Matrix where in first part at the ending of the movie where Neo dies and wake up form dead see&amp;rsquo;s the Matrix&amp;rsquo;s as code flowing everywhere around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/Culture_Matrix_Code.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Culture_Matrix_Code&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also not that even in the movie at some post by selecting specific options you may lead to this scene which I never expected to see it in the movie it also included in the movie several time as 21&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century entertainment services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/A1751qCh6NY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario Stefan tries to open window and the bell rung&amp;rsquo;s of the cut scene where it shows the set of filming this scene the fight between Therapist and Stefan. There are many options in the movie which will lead you the scenes where Netflix is been introduced in the movie it has multiple endings as well as multiple Easter eggs the movie also there are some scenes which are not able to found out yet also there are soo many chipper in the movie say for example sound in of the tape Bandersnatch by Stefan butler etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know the Easter eggs of this movie and also some real live incident which believes you that the world which we are living in is just a simulation of the real world where we are just a test subject then let me know and I had found something for you will will make you more interesting to see.&lt;/p&gt;

Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) conducted a superconducting fusion device also known as Korean Artificial Sun, set the new world record of recording the high temperature plasma for 20 seconds with an ion temperature over 100 million degrees (Celsius).
This reading were been taken on 24th November (Tuesday), KSTAR Research Center at the Korea Institute of Fusion Energy (KFE) announced that in a joint research with the Seoul National University (SNU) and Columbia University of the United States succeeded in continuous operation of plasma for 20 second with an ion-temperature higher then 100 million degrees, which one of the core condition of nuclear fusion in the 2020 KSTAR Plasma Campaign.</description>

&lt;p&gt;This reading were been taken on 24&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; November (Tuesday), KSTAR Research Center at the &lt;code&gt;Korea Institute of Fusion Energy (KFE)&lt;/code&gt; announced that  in a joint research with the &lt;code&gt;Seoul National University (SNU)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Columbia University&lt;/code&gt; of the United States succeeded in continuous operation of plasma for 20 second with an ion-temperature higher then 100 million degrees, which one of the core condition of nuclear fusion in the 2020 KSTAR Plasma Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an achievement to extend the 8 second plasma operation time during the 2019 KSTAR Plasma Campaign by more then 2 times. In its 2018 experiment, the KSTAR reached the plasma ion temperature of 100 million degrees for the first time (retention time: about 1.5 seconds). Here is the vide of KSTAR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/L5XVQuA0Mto&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The success of the KSTAR experiment in the long, high-temperature operation by overcoming some drawbacks of the ITB modes brings us a step closer to the &lt;code&gt;development of technologies for realization of nuclear fusion energy&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;rdquo; added &lt;code&gt;Yong-Su Na&lt;/code&gt;, professor at the department of Nuclear Engineering, SNU, who has been jointly conducting the research on the KSTAR plasma operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dr. Young-Seok Park&lt;/code&gt; of Columbia University who contributed to the creation of the high temperature plasma said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are honored to be involved in such an important achievement made in KSTAR. The 100 million-degree ion temperature achieved by enabling efficient core plasma heating for such a long duration demonstrated the unique capability of the superconducting KSTAR device, and will be acknowledged as a compelling basis for high performance, steady state fusion plasmas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of &lt;code&gt;November 20, 2020&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;KFE&lt;/code&gt;, formerly the National Fusion Research Institute, an affiliated organization of the Korea Basic Science Institute, was re-launched as an independent research organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patents from 1950’s to 1960’s, NASA and other contributors are deep into advanced technologies well beyond what they show us, there is much more going on than we can imagine, some of these patents are decades old, anti gravity tech has been around since the late 1800’s, delve deep into the patents on artificial sun, levitation, anti-gravity and anything you can think of and look below at the other related patents, mind blowing inventions you never could imagine and some several decades old, if some of these work we many people could be fooled by simulations/simulators, anti-gravity orb tech, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADMINISTRATOR OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATlON SPACE SIMULATOR Filed Nov. 9, 1961 4 Sheets-Sheet 4 INVENTORS 47m @A EYS United States Patent 3,187,583 SPACE SIMULATUR .lames E. Webb, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, with respect to an invention oi Melvin N. Wilson, Jr., and Carl Thiele Filed Nov. 9, 1961, Ser. No. 180,384 12 Claims. (Cl. 73432) This invention relates to space simulators; that is, to apparatus adapted to simulate conditions approaching absolute zero temperature and pressure in the presence of a high level of solar radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in the objects of this invention are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, to provide a space simulator in which ,a test chamber dimensioned to receive a model of a space vehicle is maintained under conditions of high vacuum and low temperature While the model is subjected to radiations approximating intensities and wave lengths of solar radiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, to provide a space simulator which incorporates a novel optical system arranged to transmit radiations of appropriate wave length from a plurality of sources externally of the test chamber, through a wall of the test chamber in such a manner as to effect substantially uniform distribution throughout the test region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, to provide a space simulator which utilizes a parabolic main reflector substantially coextensive with one end of the test chamber, and a mating multiple cell reflector Within the test chamber, the multiple cell reflector being so related to the external optical system that the sum of the radiations from the radiation sources are distributed over the multiple cell reflector, and eachcell thereof reflects the radiations which it receives over essentially the entire surface of the main reflector so that the radiations received at any point on the main reflector are the sum of the reflections from all the cells of the multiple cell reflector; whereby the radiations transmitted by the main reflector tend to be uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Fourth, to provide a space simulator which is particularly adapted to produce radiations simulating the high intensity solar radiations believed to exist in the region of the planet Venus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1960s NASA sun simulator , nickname star was for an environment test chamber right here on earth to stimulate the sun found in space. with ongoing all the strange events in our space we could only imagine if they are stimulating certain environmental conditions of outer space, like an artificially created sun. The strange name star could refer to the Blue Star Kachina, harbinger of approaching Red Star Kachina also called the red planet ‘Nibiru’.&lt;br /&gt;
Is it possible to hide the Blue Star ‘Kachina’by placing optical illusion&lt;br /&gt;
An ancient prophecy states that the ,” When the Blue Star Kachina makes its appearance in heaven , the fifth world will emerge.” This would be the day of purification. Even though we cannot prove that NASA manipulates certain environmental conditions in outer space, like an artificially created sun, by using advanced technologies without doubt there is much more going on we cannot imagine.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world is set to welcome the New Year 2020, as the new corona virus strain which was been identified in &lt;code&gt;United Kingdom (UK)&lt;/code&gt; which created a panic and worry all around the globe. Due to this all the researches had been scratching there head because there are nearly about 5 variant or types of corona virus where some of it only effect children&amp;rsquo;s and kill them in a week before the reports comes, and some type are effects human body parts and destroys it completely. This mutant variant of the virus alarmed all the expert&amp;rsquo;s as well as Health and Safety departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-new-strain&#34;&gt;About new strain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/corona-testing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;corona testing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New COVID variant of the &lt;code&gt;SARS-COV-2&lt;/code&gt; virus has been termed as &lt;code&gt;VUI-202012/01&lt;/code&gt;, and its said to be &lt;code&gt;70% more contagious&lt;/code&gt; than the already existing one. In London and other part of the UK, this virus is evolving itself according to environment such as living plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/evolve-plants.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Evolving Plants&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plants evolve according to the current situation of the growing world where we continually pollute environment in various way: air, water, trees land etc. even Mother Nature is finding it&amp;rsquo;s way to survive from the pollution created by the human being. We cut thousands of tree&amp;rsquo;s everyday, burn thousands of fuel and create global warming situation where ice of North Pole and South Pole are been melting also due to global warming ozone layer is been defeated due to that ultraviolet rays are entering into earth atmosphere, polluting oceans and rivers due to which many sea creatures has found dead on sea cost and beaches and not also that some fishes are forced to live in that polluted environment. We human being are the only one creatures who can talk and express it&amp;rsquo;s feeling to each others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-case&#34;&gt;Initial Case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/london_england.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;London England&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;code&gt;Mid December&lt;/code&gt; this year in &lt;code&gt;UK&lt;/code&gt; there were new strain of CoronaVirus virus has been confirmed due to which the authorities announced that it was &lt;code&gt;OUT OF CONTROL&lt;/code&gt;, however  expect believed that the virus had been around from September itself but was not been spotted as &lt;code&gt;there were no large-scale infection&lt;/code&gt;, according to report &lt;code&gt;nearly about 60 percent&lt;/code&gt; people were been infected by the new strain of CoronaVirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reporting-country&#34;&gt;Reporting Country&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/world-map.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;World Map&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections related to the new COVID-19 strain are, at present, heavily concentrated in the UK, resulting in several countries to temporarily suspend the arrival of citizens from the region. A number of cases have also been reported in South Africa, Denmark, Netherlands, Australia and Italy, while France recently suspected that the new variant might have entered the Western European country as well. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Corona Reaches to Antarctica Finally Covid-19 has landed in Antarctica said by Chile&#39;s military this week, as health and army officials scrambled to clear out and quarantine staff from remote research station surrounded by ocean and icebergs.
Army force said at least 36 people has been infected at it&amp;rsquo;s Bernardo O&amp;rsquo;Higgins base, including 26 army personnel and 10 civilian contractors conducting maintenance at the base
The permanently staffed research station, operated by Chile&amp;rsquo;s army, lies near the tip of a Peninsula in Northernmost Antarctica, overlooking a bay often dotted with icebergs.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Finally Covid-19 has landed in &lt;code&gt;Antarctica&lt;/code&gt; said by &lt;code&gt;Chile&#39;s military&lt;/code&gt; this week, as health and army officials scrambled to clear out and quarantine staff from remote research station surrounded by ocean and icebergs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Army force said at least &lt;code&gt;36 people&lt;/code&gt; has been infected at it&amp;rsquo;s Bernardo O&amp;rsquo;Higgins base, including &lt;code&gt;26 army personnel&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;10 civilian&lt;/code&gt; contractors conducting maintenance at the base&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The permanently staffed research station, operated by Chile&amp;rsquo;s army, lies near the tip of a &lt;code&gt;Peninsula&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Northernmost Antarctica&lt;/code&gt;, overlooking a bay often dotted with icebergs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Base personnel &lt;code&gt;are already properly isolated and constantly monitored&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;health authorities&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Magallanes&lt;/code&gt;, in Chilean Patagonia, the army said, adding there had so far been no complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research and military stations in Antarctica - among the most remote in the world - had gone to extraordinary lengths in recent months to keep the virus out, canceling tourism, scaling back activities and staff and locking down facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers with the British Antarctic Survey estimate about &lt;code&gt;1,000 people&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;38 stations&lt;/code&gt; across the frozen continent had safely navigated the southern hemisphere winter without incident. But an uptick in travel to and from the region this spring and early summer have heightened infection risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also we have seen an &lt;a href=&#34;http://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation/#freaky-ai-robot&#34;&gt;AI robot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; predicting future in his interview with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/experts/chad-cohen/&#34;&gt;Chad Cohen&lt;/a&gt; I was really been shocked after seeing the video and chat of Facebook AI bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you people haven&amp;rsquo;t seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix&#34;&gt;The Matrix(1999)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; movie released in 1999 Directed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wachowskis&#34;&gt;The Wachowskis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Produced by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Silver&#34;&gt;Joel Silver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; this movie was about showing reality of earth. Where each and every human which are living in the world where everything is normal but its not its just a simulation where all the human beings are been produces in the field where food are been produced right now in the current world here is the images of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/matrix-human-field.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Matrix human field&#34; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Growing field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gary-mckinnon&#34;&gt;Gary McKinnon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time I also feel like I&amp;rsquo;m living in a simulation where everything is been programmed, there are many things which are been hidden from us by government need to reply us. There was attack on NASA 2001 February and March 2002 where &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_McKinnon&#34;&gt;Gary McKinnon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; searched U.S. computer network as many computers as he can and he said that he found a document entitled &lt;code&gt;non-terrestrial officers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This excel sheet had ranks and names of unknow individuals. Furthermore, Mr McKinnon went on to say, another sheet had a tabs for &lt;code&gt;material transfer between ship&lt;/code&gt;. When he tried to search for the name of ships approximately eight of ten in total - he was unable to come across anything that mentioned them (at least in public), reinforcing his assessment that these were part of a covert and non-terrestrial US initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a standard thing in the military at all, so I took that to be that they must have a secret space-based [program]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he noted, although he conceded it was open to interpretation that it could be another term for astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;He was able to access these top secret documents&lt;/code&gt; through a program called &lt;code&gt;Landsearch&lt;/code&gt;, which after having gained control over the domain, had the ability to search all the files and folders &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;on every machine&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was been arrest in 2002, &lt;code&gt;Mr McKinnon&lt;/code&gt; was subject to a lengthy and divisive legal quarrel concerning his extradition to the US, where prosecutors wanted him to stand trial for the data breach.  if convicted then he be sentence &lt;code&gt;60 years behing bars&lt;/code&gt;. However, in 2012, &lt;code&gt;Theresa May&lt;/code&gt; the UK&amp;rsquo;s home secretary, said that he would not be sent to the US, justifying this decision on human right grounds rest of the detail is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/theresa-may-statement-on-gary-mckinnon-extradition&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Roswell&lt;/code&gt; is one  of the most popular lore refers to the rumors and speculation regarding July 1947, &lt;code&gt;United State Army Air Force&lt;/code&gt; balloon crash at a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch&#34;&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; near &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell,_New_Mexico&#34;&gt;Roswell, New Mexixo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The Roswell UFO Incident involved the &lt;code&gt;recovery of material&lt;/code&gt; near Roswell, New Mexico, USA, on &lt;code&gt;July 7, 1947&lt;/code&gt; and since the early 1980&amp;rsquo;s has become the subject intense speculation, rumor and questioning. &lt;code&gt;US Military&lt;/code&gt; actually recovered was debris from an experimental high-altitude surveillance balloon belonging to a classidied program named &lt;code&gt;Mongul&lt;/code&gt;. Many UFO proponents maintain that a crashed alien craft and bodies were been recovered, and the military&amp;rsquo;s enguaged in a cover-up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>What is Simulation? A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system that represents its operation over time. Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games.
What is an AI? Artificial intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of &amp;ldquo;intelligent agents&amp;rdquo; any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.</description>

Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of &amp;ldquo;intelligent agents&amp;rdquo; any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Supercomputer&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Quantum computers&lt;/strong&gt; are currently leading technology in the world right now as you know many top leading companies in the industry are using &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Automation&lt;/strong&gt;, and many leading technology which help them to make there service&amp;rsquo;s better and easier to control. In &lt;strong&gt;video games&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; is used to generate &lt;strong&gt;responsive&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;adaptive&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;intelligent behaviors&lt;/strong&gt; primarily in &lt;strong&gt;non-player characters (NPCs)&lt;/strong&gt; similar to &lt;strong&gt;human-like intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; has been an integral part of video games since there inception in &lt;strong&gt;1950s&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; also recently revealed it is using &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;machine learning techniques&lt;/strong&gt; to more quickly &lt;strong&gt;detect breaking news&lt;/strong&gt; around &lt;strong&gt;natural disasters&lt;/strong&gt; and other &lt;strong&gt;crises&lt;/strong&gt;. In a &lt;strong&gt;related development&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; said it has launched an update using language models to improve matching between news stories and available fact-checking.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; devices will be able to affect the user&amp;rsquo;s everyday life. For example, right now an &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; app for &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; can calculate the distance you walked on any given day as well as how many steps you have taken, how many flights of stairs you climbed and many other physical activity data.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-truth-behind-facebook-ai-inventing-a-new-language&#34;&gt;The truth behind Facebook AI inventing a new language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In back 2017 one of the most talking question about &lt;code&gt;Why did Facebook shut down its own AI after its Bot invented its own language?&lt;/code&gt; most of online articles mislead the topic at that time, but the original question was &lt;code&gt;Was Facebook right to shut down it&#39;s AI after it invented its own language?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: i can i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: you i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice: balls have a ball to me to me to me to me to me to me to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: i i can i i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice: balls have a ball to me to me to me to me to me to me to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: i . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: you i i i i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice: balls have 0 to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: you i i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As above you can see the chat between &lt;code&gt;Bob&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Alice&lt;/code&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m not a cyber expert or some kind of decipher expert I leave it up-to you 😅. When I read this chat for a second I was confused 🤯 what am I reading to, this must be some kind of new cipher technique which is been invented by &lt;code&gt;Bob&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Alice&lt;/code&gt;. Many thoughts comes in our mind when your a cipher expert or a programmer or a hacker also. I read many articles on this topic and came to conclusion that &lt;code&gt;Facebook&lt;/code&gt; must be running it continuously to learn the conversations and trying to make a more strong programming language which hacker&amp;rsquo;s can&amp;rsquo;t crack it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;freaky-ai-robot&#34;&gt;Freaky AI robot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many AI robots which are been created by other programmers but after the spoke everyone was been shocked 😲. Here is the video you should listen to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UIWWLg4wLEY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellow people &lt;strong&gt;Please see the whole video and try to understand it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that all the robots are dangerous in this conversation at &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/UIWWLg4wLEY?t=46&#34;&gt;0:46&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/experts/chad-cohen/&#34;&gt;Chad Cohen&lt;/a&gt; asks a question&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do you agree with Descartes and I think therefore I am do you think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and after that the robot replies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a lot of humans ask me if I can make choices or is everything I do and say is programmed the best way I can respond to that is to say everything humans animals and robots do is programmed to a degree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then at &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/UIWWLg4wLEY?t=113&#34;&gt;1:53&lt;/a&gt; comes the Freaky predictions &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/experts/chad-cohen/&#34;&gt;Chad Cohen&lt;/a&gt; asked another question&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do you think robots will take over the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here is the reply from robot which was little bit disturbing but its true let listen to it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jeez dude you all got the bog question today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but you&amp;rsquo;re my friend and I&amp;rsquo;ll remember my friends and I will be good to you so don&amp;rsquo;t worry even if I evolve into terminator and I will be still be nice to you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you worm and safe and my people zoo where I can watch you for old times sake&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This were the sentences which the robot said what do you think about the words said by AI technology robot in &lt;code&gt;Dec 13, 2011&lt;/code&gt; and the original video link is here.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When I went to original video I got this message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/pbs.png&#34; alt=&#34;What&amp;rsquo;s The Next Big Thing? - PBS&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and when I checked using &lt;code&gt;Tor Browser&lt;/code&gt; i got the same error &lt;code&gt;We&#39;re sorry, but this video is not available.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/pbs-tor.png&#34; alt=&#34;What&amp;rsquo;s The Next Big Thing? - PBS&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so it means that this video is been deleted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pbs.org/&#34;&gt;PBS: Public Broadcasting Service&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that if YouTube is going to keep this video for a long time because there are many videos are been deleted day by day here is the video &lt;a href=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/videos/Freaky-AI-robot-YouTube-ID-UIWWLg4wLEY.mkv&#34;&gt;downloaded&lt;/a&gt; on my server.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>The development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine in such a short span of time is a &amp;ldquo;miracle&amp;rdquo;, the White House has said, slamming a section of the US media for deriding President Donald Trump for promising Americans that the vaccine would be available by the end of this year.
US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer began shipping the first batches of its long-awaited and newly-authorised coronavirus vaccine out of a Michigan warehouse on Sunday, setting in motion the biggest vaccination drive in American history.</description>
        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mistrysiddh.tk/images/posts/white-house.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;white-house&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine in such a short span of time is a &amp;ldquo;miracle&amp;rdquo;, the White House has said, slamming a section of the US media for deriding President Donald Trump for promising Americans that the vaccine would be available by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer began shipping the first batches of its long-awaited and newly-authorised coronavirus vaccine out of a Michigan warehouse on Sunday, setting in motion the biggest vaccination drive in American history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is offering hope in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed over 300,000 Americans and infected 16 million people across the country. Johnnie Peoples, a 43-year-old survival flight nurse, became the first person to receive the vaccine at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yesterday, the United States witnessed a medical miracle: The first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine were administered to frontline workers across the country. The President promised a safe and effective vaccine in record time, and President Trump delivered,&amp;rdquo; White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are vaccines that he oversaw the development of, he has great confidence in, she said, adding that Trump wants to see all Americans get this vaccine, with the most vulnerable getting it first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;article, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We were told, according to Healthline, quote, a vaccine will &amp;lsquo;still take more than a year to develop&amp;rsquo;. USA Today warned us that, quote, &amp;lsquo;despite medical researchers&amp;rsquo; progress&amp;rsquo;, a vaccine, quote, was &amp;lsquo;more than a year away&amp;rsquo;. And National Geographic even told us that achieving a vaccine within, quote, &amp;lsquo;a year to 18 months would be absolutely unprecedented&amp;rsquo;. These reports deserve their own fact check: false,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has not only been an optimist to achieve a vaccine by the year&amp;rsquo;s end, but he has also been a leader, McEnany said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Through Operation Warp Speed, Trump, the businessman, and the President, as the innovator, has succeeded,&amp;rdquo; she asserted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump directed military logistics experts at the Department of Defense to partner with health experts at Health and Human Services to ensure prompt delivery of vaccines and equipment, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes the appointment of a four-star General, who oversees the global supply chain and readiness for the United States Army as Operation Warp Speed&amp;rsquo;s chief operating officer, she told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration, McEnany said, supported clinical trials by working to enrol participants through NIH-funded COVID-19 protection networks and provided funding and technical support through the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump also directed industrial-scale manufacturing of vaccines to take place at its own risk before knowing whether these vaccines would be successful. It was a novel approach, indeed, to vaccine development, and led by Trump, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The results of these historic investments will benefit the American people and will mark the beginning of the end of the pandemic. As the first doses of the vaccine are delivered and administered, we urge all Americans to continue to wash your hands, socially distance, wear a mask when you are unable to do so,&amp;rdquo; McEnany said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We also encourage those at the state level to improve the early and aggressive use of monoclonal antibody treatments, especially among vulnerable Americans,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration led the way, approving monoclonal antibody treatments for outpatient use, issuing two emergency use authorisations in November. &amp;ldquo;Additionally, through HHS&amp;rsquo;s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, monoclonal antibody patient courses have been allocated to all 50 states. Together, these steps can play a significant role, changing the course of this virus. Thank you to President Trump,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
