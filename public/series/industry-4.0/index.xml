        <description>Robotics Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that substitute for (or replicate) human actions. As you have seen in the movie such as I robot, wall-e, Transformer etc. where robots are been there. As time passes technology also evolves not also that it gets smatter and smatter also.
What is a Robot? A robot is the product of the robotics field, where programmable machines are built that can assist humans or mimic human actions.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that substitute for (or replicate) human actions. As you have seen in the movie such as I robot, wall-e, Transformer etc. where robots are been there. As time passes technology also evolves not also that it gets smatter and smatter also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-a-robot&#34;&gt;What is a Robot?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/posts/robotic-arm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Robotic Arm&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A robot is the product of the robotics field, where programmable machines are built that can assist humans or mimic human actions. Robots were originally built to handle monotonous tasks (like building cars on an assembly line), but have since expanded well beyond their initial uses to perform tasks like fighting fires, cleaning homes and assisting with incredibly intricate surgeries. Each robot has a differing level of autonomy, ranging from human-controlled bots that carry out tasks that a human has full control over to fully-autonomous bots that perform tasks without any external influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;characteristics&#34;&gt;Characteristics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/posts/robot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Robot Characteristics&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robots all consist of some sort of mechanical construction. The mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete tasks in the environment for which it’s designed. For example, the Mars 2020 Rover’s wheels are individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the harsh terrain of the red planet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robots need electrical components that control and power the machinery. Essentially, an electric current (a battery, for example) is needed to power a large majority of robots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robots contain at least some level of computer programming. Without a set of code telling it what to do, a robot would just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know when and how to carry out a task.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;utilization-of-robotics&#34;&gt;Utilization of Robotics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the International Federation of Robotics, 1.3 million industrial robots will be in use by 2018. Robotics continues to emerge as a large and influential market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following five industries are utilizing this new technology to boost efficiency and convenience for both businesses and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-health-care&#34;&gt;1. Health Care&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/posts/surgical-robot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Surgical Robot&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Advances in robotics have the potential to change a wide variety of health care practices, such as surgery, rehabilitation, therapy, patient companionship, and everyday activities. Robotic instruments used in health care are not designed to take over the duties of health care professionals, but rather to make their work easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The da Vinci Surgical System, for example, utilizes the hand movements of the operating surgeon to control tiny, precise instruments inside the patient’s body. This allows for minimally invasive procedures in surgeries such as cardiac, colorectal, gynecologic, head and neck, thoracic, and urologic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For patients who have suffered strokes or spinal cord injuries, or who are paralyzed, robotic devices such as exoskeletons have the ability to assist and guide them during rehabilitation. In addition, robotic lifting machines can help nurses lift patients who are elderly or immobile. Companion and therapeutic robots such as Paro can also comfort patients with mental health issues with a system of sensors, microphones, and cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-agriculture&#34;&gt;2. Agriculture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/posts/farm-robots.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Farm Robots&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To help increase productivity while lowering overall costs, the agriculture industry has been actively working to adopt different forms of robotic technology. Farmers have already been using tractors and harvesters that are self-guided by GPS. Recently, there has been a rise in the experimental use of autonomous systems that automate operations like pruning, thinning, mowing, spraying, and weed removal. Sensor technology is also being utilized to manage pests and diseases that affect crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-food-preparation&#34;&gt;3. Food Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/posts/food-robots.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Food line robot&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One of the more extravagant advancements in robot technology will soon be available in the kitchen. Automated and intelligent robots — such as those invented by Moley Robotics — will be able to prepare and cook hundreds of meals in a home kitchen. This robotic chef will be controlled via a smartphone, and once the controller chooses a recipe and arranges pre-packaged containers of cut and prepared ingredients, the robot will be able to cook the predetermined meal quickly and efficiently. Moley Robotics is also developing a consumer-friendly version of a robot kitchen, which will include a built-in smart dishwasher and refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-manufacturing&#34;&gt;4. Manufacturing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/posts/industrial-robot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Manufacturing&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Robotics are being used in many aspects of manufacturing to help increase productivity and efficiency while lowering production costs. Similar to the health care industry, many robots in manufacturing collaborate with workers to perform repetitive, monotonous, or intricate tasks under the worker’s guidance and control. With these machines, precision is valued more than speed, as is the ability to be reprogrammed for specific tasks of different sizes and complexities. Robotic manufacturing technology is also becoming safer to operate. Cameras, sensors, and automatic shut-off capabilities enable robots to sense and stay clear of humans in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;5-military&#34;&gt;5. Military&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/posts/ArmyGroundRobot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Army Ground Robot&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the military and public safety sectors, robotic technology is being applied in many areas. One highly visible area involves unmanned drones. These machines can be used for surveillance and support operations on the battlefield. Military drones flying over areas of war and conflict, in hostage situations, and for natural and manmade disasters are able to assess danger levels and provide soldiers and first responders with real-time information. Drones are revolutionizing disaster response since they can access hazardous areas with greater speed and precision without placing human responders in harm’s way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robotic devices are already establishing a wide presence in several commercial industries. As robotic technologies become more affordable, they will soon be available in various forms for consumers as well, with the ability to impact our lives in countless ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros--cons&#34;&gt;Pros &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;pros&#34;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and the foremost advantage of having robots in workplaces is their cost. Robots are much cheaper than humans and their cost is now decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fact that we cannot compare human abilities with robots but robotic capabilities are now growing quickly. For example, if you run an essay writing service, you can use robots to perform every kind of research related to any subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because robots are more active and don’t get tired like humans, the collaboration between humans and robots is reducing absenteeism. The pace of human cannot increase hence robots are helping humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots are more precise than humans; they don’t tremble or shake as human hands. Robots have smaller and versatile moving parts which help them in performing tasks with more accuracy than humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that robots are significantly stronger and faster than humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots come in any shape and size, depending upon the need of the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots can work anywhere in any environmental condition whether it is space, underwater, in extreme heat or wind etc. Robots can be used everywhere where human safety is a huge concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots are programmed by a human; they cannot say no to anything and can be used for any dangerous and unwanted work where humans may deny to offer their services. For example, many robotic probes have been sent into space but have never returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots in warfare are saving more lives and have now proven to be very successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots are now being used in the chemical industry and can, for example deal with chemical spills in a nuclear plant, which would otherwise pose a major health concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing about robots is that they never get tired and can literally work on certain tasks 24 x 7. The human brain gets tired if it’s working continuously but robots never get tired of what they are programmed to do and they can work on certain tasks error free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cons&#34;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where robots are increasing the efficiency in many businesses, they are also increasing the unemployment rate. Because of robots, human labour is no longer required in many factories and manufacturing plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots can certainly handle their prescribed tasks, but they typically cannot handle unexpected situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ROI of your business may suffer if your operation relies on too many robots. They have higher expenses than humans, so at the end of the day you may not always achieve the desired ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots may have AI but they are certainly not as intelligent as humans. They can never improve their jobs outside the pre-defined programming because they simply cannot think for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots installed in workplaces still require manual labour attached to them. Training those employees on how to work with the robots definitely has a cost attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots have no sense of emotions or conscience. They lack empathy and this is one major disadvantage of having an emotionless workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots operate on the basis of information fed to them through a chip. If one thing goes wrong the entire company bears the loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where a robot saves times, on the other hand it can also result in a lag. It is, after all, a machine so you cannot expect too much from them. If a robot malfunctions, you need extra time to fix it, which would require reprogramming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ultimately robots would do all the work, and the humans will just sit and monitor them, health hazards will increase rapidly. Obesity will be on top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are advantages, but there are disadvantages as well. It is the twenty first century and we cannot work without machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are still considered far more efficient than robots when it comes to decision making powers, handling difficult situations, brainstorming, and generally bringing a sense of emotion and empathy into a workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
